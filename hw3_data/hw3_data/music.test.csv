" joan. you don't love me. because i'm a guy. but i have loved you since 1976. ok so i'm an old man (age 43). so what. she's just the best rock and roll female on the planet. i like the young ones like sahara hotnights and the donnas as well but they just don't measure up to joan born to be bad jett. this album - like most of her other albums - consists of a mix of old and new songs. doesn't mattar. i love it. and the video... well it confirms what we have always known. not that it matters. the music matters ",positive
" so far so good...so what! (in it's origional form) used to conjure feeling. the remastered edition sounds like a group of studio musicians tried to remake the album and just didn't quite hit the nail on the head. if you bought this album on cassette when it came out in the late 80s get your hands on that version.

" kate bush's second album lionheart may be the weakest in her catalog. its clear bush did not want to fall into the trap of constructing the kick inside part two and instead reaches in a number of different directions some successful some less so. musically the album takes stabs at ballads similar to the first record (in search of peter pan in the warm room) a more pop structure (wow) rhythmic shifts (don't put your foot on the heartbrake) an almost shuffle (fullhouse) and a gret rock song (hammer horror). lyrically bush has added a level of sensuality to her work (symphony in blue) and shows no sign of shying away from controversial subjects (kashka from baghdad). the problem is that it doesn't hang together well to my mind-- admittedly my rating for the album is in many ways relative to bush's other work no album with the absolutelyu amazing kashka from baghdad can be all that bad and certainly symphony in blue is strong enough to stop you in your tracks but the album just doesn't work for me. for early bush try her debut (the kick inside) or the stunning never for ever ",negative

" history has a way of making the radical seem conservative and certainly within the context of cecil taylor's music his debut album jazz advance is rather conservative. taylor known for his relentless dense music did not emerge fully formed (although even at this early date his music is far removed from his hard bop contemporaries) but developed over time. for those of us who enjoy taylor's music this record is a historical curiosity for anyone else its either going to sound as one permutation further from the early ornette coleman idiom (indeed this music is far closer to coleman's sound than anything taylor would be doing in the '60s or later). my understanding is that when this was first released it raised quite a stir. its a bit difficult to see why. taylor is largely melodic-- performing pieces with coherent themes-- his experimentations seem to be in the use of block chords odd inversions and in soloing underneath the primary voice at this point. the record is four originals and four standards and as one would suspect taylor largely breathes on his own compositions. he is backed by nearly inaudible bassist buell neidlinger and drummer dennis charles with soprano sax player steve lacy on two tracks. neidlinger and charles are far closer in the hard bop idiom-- their performances swing charles in particular is playing way inside hard bop. this puts them a bit at odds with taylor who while he gives more space than he would on his later work is still more of a neoclassical improvising pianist than a jazz pianist. when lacy plays taylor's form of comping doesn't seem fully formed or lacy doesn't seem quite prepared to play inside taylor's environment and as a result he sounds somewhat detached from the pianist. the sounds of the future can clearly be heard on several tracks bemsha swing features many of taylor's clustered chords and runs solo piano take on you'd be so nice to come home to presents the theme in a barely recognizable fashion and is as close to his future organized chaos as he'd get and while original rick kick shaw is far away from where he'd end up its the first sign of the short of aggression that taylor would harness in the future. the music is enjoyable enough but taylor would reach such heights that its hard to not listen to this without comparing it to his future works. the other complaint is the sound-- this issue is from 1991 and is in desparate need of remastering. in the end this is an album of historical value. if you're looking for an introduction to taylor's music and aren't ready to dive head first into his methods try looking ahead! its a far superior album by which point neidlinger and charles (who reprise their roles) were far more closely integrated with taylor's music ",negative
" before you get all worked up let me say that he has a voice but he really doesn't have a style. he sings songs way too straight he makes even bobby short sound like an improviser! he also doesn't seem to be in touch with his masculine side his vocie is very well if ying is male and yang is female he sounds very yang. he needs to take some liberties with the songs he sings and then he won't sound so obnoxious then he needs to take some vocal lessons and try to bring out the ying(masculine side) in his voice. he needs to hear a few billy eckstine lp's. i don't think he can change but here's hoping he'll take my advice. as far as you buying this cd it is your decision this is just my honest opinion ",negative

" this is a compilation but the original incense and peppermints album was really revolutinary for the time. i will date myself now but i remember hearing this song on the radio in our car and was mesmerized by it. it was the first lp i had ever bought. i actually wore out the groves on the lp and came across another a few years ago. to this day almost 40 years after i first heard the strawberry alarm clock i still like incense and peppermints as well as their other songs. their style ranges from acid rock to jazz. the musicians are all very talented and the band works as a team as opposed to many of the bands of the era. their recordings are really high quality and certainly not over processed like a lot of today's music is. sac was in an era where 60's music was in transition from the early beatles and old time r&r sound to a more acid rock sound. lyrics like 'tune in turn on turn your eyes around.. look at yourself' were typical of sac's lyrical style as well as the thinking of the times. it was an odd time. on one side we had woodstock mini-skirts muscle cars and fun fun fun but on the dark side there were civil rights problems and the viet nam war. this transitional period was a kind of awakening for the country and for music. although not as popular as names like the doors jefferson airplane and steppenwolf the strawberry alarm clock still had a huge following. my only regret is that i didn't get a chance to see them (or the doors!) when they came to the city where i lived during the late 60's. this album is a nice compilation of sac's hits. the songs are as fresh and original sounding as they were almost 40 years ago.

" this cd is the worst comedy cd i have ever heard. yet the reviews on here mostly claim it was hilarious???? ok i've come to the conclusion the only people writing positive reviews on amazon must be the people trying to sell the junk. i've seen this guy on some tv shows and on comedy central and he's a somewhat funny guy but it is painful to listen to this cd. you can feel the awkwardness of the crowd not knowing if or when to laugh. and it continues throughout the entire cd. there don't seem to be any jokes on the cd at all. it is all disconnected negative rants from a bitter angry human being. don't believe me? then go ahead and waste your money on this horrible piece of junk and see for yourself. like my review title says do not read the positive reviews. just read the negative ones and decide how credible they seem. then make your decision to buy or not buy ",negative
" as much as i hear time and again that mindcrime was the seattle quintet's finest i always have to argue that this 1986 gem is the pinnacle of their career. while i was a big fan of mindcrime and it's predecessor the warning rage for order is qr's most consistent release and is mezmerising from start to finish. in a word..perfect. so few bands can boast having made a perfect album. i can think only of the beatles (sgt. pepper & revolver to name a few) pink floyd (the wall dark side) dream theater (images & awake) and boston (debut). rage is an album to be listened to and appreciated. released in the hey-day of hair metal this album has not one single song that lends itself to the tag. none of the songs while very image provoking could be easily made into an mtv hit. although gonna get close to you aired on mtv (rarely i might add) it didn't even scratch the surface of this album's potential. overall the performances of each member outshine anything before or since. degarmo and wilton trade licks masterfully. rockenfield and jackson keep a very tight bottom end. tate...well...tate was the metal singer at that time and this was his finest performance. while the mix was somewhat lacking the production was incredible. each song blends into each other perfectly. this was metal that was unique and completely original. i think the term thinking man's metal was coined at the time. that said i can think of no other release at the time to which that term could be applied. unlike most of their metal contemporaries at the time rage was athmospheric intellectual and surreal. rage succeeded where priest's turbo failed abysmally. it was a stark vision of the future and the metal was more futuristic than we'd ever heard before. it was like listening to a whole new machine. it still holds it's own 20 year later seeming as fresh and now as anything in progressive metal.

" i think india is one of the most talented artists today. her voice is sensational. sadly as with many great artists today this album feels more producer/market-driven rather than artist-driven. i understand that regaetton is popular right now. i would even understand including a few reggaeton-flavored songs to keep up with the times (shakira's la tortura comes to mind). but who mixes two genres within a single song?!? soy differente flows perfectly as a salsa until regaetton beats come in. the style feels very out-of-place in this song as in most other songs in this album. maybe this kind of thing will work at a club but not for extended listening. in my opinion the producers are making this album more marketable while stiffling india's own style. i hope she will regain contol by the next album ",negative

" i got the lp version of this album as a christmas present in 1988. i immediately fell in love with it. she sings about issues such as unemployment and poverty which were rampant during the reagan years (talkin about a revolution fast car). but she offered hope that things would get better as we approached the 90s which they did. mountains o things was about the materialsim of the 80s. other issues she covers are racism (across the lines) and domestic abuse (behind the wall). even though this album is almost 20 years old it does not sound dated as the messages are just as relavent today as they were in 1988. i bought the cd version in 1992 and i never get tired of listening to it. all of the songs are good but my favorite ones are talking about a revolution fast car baby can i hold you mountains of things why and for my lover.

" this is what you want (1983) was a terrible album from john lydon and martin atkins. after an rift between keith levene and john lydon occured during the recording of the demo tracks atkins and lydon ran keith off and he quit the band. instead of keeping him on the finished tracks atkins and lydon removed levene and pete jones (the band's studio bassist) from the audio tracks and re-recorded them with members from their holiday inn band (lydon hired members from a covers band who performed at a new jersey holiday inn). the new tracks and horrible. all of the guitar riffs and rhythm section that were originally recorded for the future album were erased. noise and other unwelcomed sounds were added to the tracks. the original tracks were far superior (even in their basic state) to what was released. to hear them you'll have to find the commercial zone lp. the failure of this disc and the bickering between atkins and lydon would cause the band to become a solo project for the former anarchy king. not recommended ",negative

" unlike other classical-crossover artists minus emma shapplin i believe sarah brightman works for art not for money or fame or show off. like what she said in an interview she sees music a a whole--music is to be enjoyed (and categorization should never get in the way). that's apparent from this very endearing album la luna. i think this album is as a whole better than any song in it although my favourites are still the mystical figlio perduto the dreamy serenade/how fair this place the gloomy gloomy sunday and the sweet la luna. i read what a reviewer said about how any other sopranos could sing better than sarah on la luna/song to the moon. i think that's not true at all. just because the singing isn't wagnerish it doesn't mean it's easy or lacking in technique or whatever he said. i think it's easier to just sing full out operatic like say renee fleming than singing with so much passion and being lilting without losing any of the voice's qualities (laid back with 'that' voice at the beginning and successively powerful at the end). and duh she sings classical properly ffs. and tell me a name of a soprano who could sing how fair this place with such grace without sounding like a screeching steel can. i've also listened to many other versions of gloomy sunday. billie's is weird. sarah mclachlan's is out of context. sinead o' connors' is shabby although the intelligence behind the singing is fine. only sarah brightman's and bjork's versions are best for my ears. i have introduced her music (from phantom of the opera to dive to timeless to harem) to many people and apparently they enjoy them very much! there is this radio that's a favourite of us where gloomy sunday and time to say goodbye are played as much as bon jovi's it's my live and sophie ellis bextor's take me home and offspring's pretty fly. they're good music and enjoyable. albeit i also like many other sopranos. i like lucia popp's interpretation of richard strauss' lieders christa ludwig's of schubert's natalie dessay kiri te kanawa etc. : ",positive

" i recently decided to go through some of my old cds that i haven't listened toin ages. dj cheb i sabbah's maha maya: shri durga remixed&quot; was one of those cds that i came upon. this was my first exposure to indian music let alone world music. i wasn't really familiar with music outside of western culture. so this was a new experience for me. listening to &quot;maha maya&quot; shri durga remixed&quot; certainly takes the listener on a trip to india with its traditional indian melodies. i envisioned myself in the taj mahal and watching a slew of belly dancers performing. the music took me awhile for the melodies to grow on me. it is certainly by no means your traditional dance remix album. i however dug transglobal underground's version of &quot;kese kese&quot; (where's the sarangi mix&quot; right from the get go. it has a nice beat. dj cheb i sabbah did a good job at mixing and making sure that the music flowed well together. i am definitely curious to hear dj cheb's other cds now that i have re-discovered this little gem of a cd ",positive
" this album is absolutely fantastic! paul and the band are incredibly tight and sound great together. paul sounds very loose and like he's having a lot of fun - not as serious as some live shows i've heard. the songs focus mostly on his solo records with some jam and style council mixed in (all on disc two). wisely only five of the twenty three tracks are from as is now and they're the uptempo ones - it's not a hard sell by yep roc to make you buy that album if you don't already have it. the extended jams for porcelain gods/broken stones in the crowd and foot of the mountain (one of my favorite solo tracks) all are focused and don't wander so they keep your attention. the crowd is energetic and into the show and are very appreciative when the jam and style council classics get into the mix (although the sing-along to the album closing town called malice is pretty lame). i haven't listened to the somewhat difficult to find live wood concert disc for a while to give a good comparison. however since catch-flame covers all his solo discs instead of only paul weller and wild wood this is a more balanced collection. highly recommended! personal highlights: blink and you'll miss it up in suze's room porcelain gods/i walk on gilded splinters in the crowd foot of the mountain that's entertainment broken stones long hot summer shout to the to ",positive
" i was really excited when i received tone poems iii as a gift. wow grisman and brozman! two amazing fret men playing some wonderful vintage instruments. i couldn't wait to hear some excellent acoustic bluesy slide and reso music. unfortunately this recording comes across like sugar poured on the tongue. if you like sitting around in beach wear and listening to hawaiian strumming-which is at least half of it-this is the recording for you. (in fairness track 15 style o blues and track 20 new steal are wonderful. they have some drive and get-up-and-go.) i also own tone poems i which grisman did with flatpicker extraodinaire tony rice. that recording is also mostly a lightweight. i play mandolin and fiddle and recognize david grisman as the world's master with the mando. i also appreciate what he's doing with his acoustic disc recording label. these days however he seems to be better off when other musicians are running the show. the recent recordings with vasser clements and old and in the gray are great. hold on we're stummin' with sam bushis the best new mandolin record i've heard. buy it and go to acoustic heaven! for my hard-earned money however the tone poems cds have turned out to be an expensive set of matching drink coasters. i just know that musicians of this caliber playing instruments of this quality could have given us a better selection of music.

" informatively i have mason's dvd's which i quite enjoy. however this cd labelled brand new contains many repeats and situations. in fact at times i was ahead of jackie mason mouthing word for word the joke and situation he was leading up to me. mason spoke as if he was rushing to meet a deadline to the extent that much of the cd sounded like gibberish. for most of this cd i sat stone faced and suspected that perhaps the applause and clapping of hands were canned. mason in my opinion went overboard in his use of obscenities loudly and in his asidesseemingly contrived for shock value. as for me i think that this mislabelled brand new cd was a flop and i would not care to have it in my collection for fear of the impression i would leave after my demise. so another item destined for my shredder. finally i would recommend the mason dvd's which i would have preferred with a slower delivery and less obscenities that add little to his performance. robert lyons reno nevad ",negative

" they may have a new name but their sound remains the same as before. mixed with club-friendly beats and laid back drunken-style the liks have crafted the perfect party cd. tracks like &quot;run wild&quot; (possibly the best track on the cd certainly the most fun to listen to) &quot;sickness&quot; (with butch cassidy providing some very tight vocals on he hook) and the neptunes-produced &quot;best u can&quot; showcase the liks' party appeal while head-nodders like &quot;bully foot&quot; (with busta rhymes) and &quot;another round&quot; create a more relaxed vibe for the listener. the liks also get outside help from artists like fellow likwit-crewmember defari (&quot;my dear&quot;) and kurupt (the cleverly-titled &quot;promote violins&quot;). of course xzibit holds it down on his two tracks &quot;bar code&quot; and &quot;151&quot;. the only way this cd differs from their last releases is the instruments varying from violins (&quot;promote violins&quot;) trumpets (&quot;l-i-k-s&quot;) and even 40 ounce bottles (&quot;40 oz. quartet&quot; skits). the thing you shouldn't expect to find is deep lyrics or dark productions (go grab mobb deep). however copping &quot;x.o. experience&quot; could be the best refreshment for this summer's heat. if you like &quot;x.o. experience&quot; check out: &quot;xzibit - restless&quot; &quot;alkaholiks - likwidation&quot; &quot;kurupt - space boogie&quot; &quot;eastsidaz - ducez &amp; trayz&quot ",positive

" based on other reviews here and comparisons to jellyfish jason falkner and the beatles i was expecting a lot better. instead i find this work very shrill and hard to listen to. is the guy talented musically? yes. but his voice is mediocre and his songs really don't do it for me. sorry but i feel the need to give an honest assessment so others won't be mislead by the breathless reviews here. i am a big fan of power pop and all good music but this does not rank with the best of that genre ",negative
" looking at the liner photos makes clear that falkner is the prettiest thing this side of n sync (and doesn't he know it especially in the shot of him being served what appears to be a large dose of johnnie walker black by a leggy bunny flight attendant). which raises the question: is this the recond a boy band member would turn out if he got the idea he was an artist? not to put too fine an edge on it let's say bluntly that this is a vanity project by a middling talent. falkner does everything on the cd and my reaction is so what? his voice is mediocre; his lyrics are banal (&quot;life can be just like a painting full of wonderful strangeness&quot;) or precious (&quot;suspended on this stage of grace i have to remember this sound&quot;); the layers of sound he tracks down are just that -- layers of sound with a disspiriting sameness song after song. give him two stars simply because he can do all the stuff on the record but this guy needs to become a whole lot less full of himself and to spend a year or two listening to say chrissie hynde and john hiatt cds. we'll let him come back then and try to write and play some adult love songs ",negative
" well it's not quite as good as rising which is the best album ever but it's still amazing. 1.man on the silver mountain- 10/10 this track is a classic and is still played at every dio concert and ritchie blackmore still performed it at every rainbow concert until rainbow disbanded in 1997 but anyway this may be ritchie blackmore's strongest riff ever! and dio's vocal performance is excellent. anyway it's a great fantasy song by dio and blackmore and still got radio play so it appeals to everyone. 2.self portrait- 10/10 excellent dark song by the band which fits dio's voice perfectly another classic! 3.black sheep of the family- 8/10 good song but not a rainbow song it's a cover and that's a shame because i would have loved to hear dio's brilliant lyrics another original song but anyway still a good listen 4.catch the rainbow- 10/10 another classic from this album as dio shows how well he can sing ballads as well as epics and rockers. blackmore has a solo full of feeling and this was performed at every rainbow concert until dio left the band. 5.snake charmer- 10/10 another song that takes place in the middle ages which is rainbow's trademark. anyway this song is very underrated and should have been a classic. dio has brilliant lyrics and vocals as usual and it's no suprise that blackmore supplied excellent solos and riffs for this one 6.temple of the king- 10/10 here is the best ballad of all time!!! ronnie's vocals are perfect for this song and his lyrics are amazing too. blackmore throws togethor and a great arrangemant and solo aswell to make this maybe the best track on the album. 7.if you don't like rock n roll- 8/10 kind of cheesy lyrics but a good track and it sounds more like an elf track. 8.sixteenth century greensleeves- 10/10 great song! a real classic as dio puts togethor another great fantasy song. blackmore's riffs is brilliant and his solo is full of bends and shredding. 9.still i'm sad- 10/10 well the version with vocals is much than this instrumental version but this version is brilliant too. the live version off on stage however with dio's vocals blow it away. i still wonder why there weren't any vocals on this. the band is ronnie james dio- vocals ritchie blackmore- guitar gary driscoll- drums mickey lee soule- keyboards piano mellatron craig guber- bass 2 ",positive
" while not dissimilar to other excellent acts such as coldplay keane and pete yorn travis have distinguished themselves as a band with their own unique style and sound. this their 2nd album is the best of their music: melodic throughout with catchy tunes solid lyrics and tremendous guitar work that captures the listener from the first chords of 'sing' to the fade-out from 'the humpty dumpty love song'. if you buy an album once you know three or four or more of its songs are excellent then i confidently recommend the invisible band to you. rating each song individually for one's ipod: 1. sing side the cage afterglow and the humpty dumpty love song are each worthy of four to five stars 2. pipe dreams flowers in the window safe follow the light and indefinitely are three to four star songs 3. the balance are two to three stars each. the only poor effort is probably last train which is too plodding relative to its counterparts the invisible band is basically a healthy mix of folksy hopeful songs mixed with just the right amount of melancholy. nowhere is this better reflected than in 'the humpty dumpty love song' which defines this mix perfectly. while this is the best of the album the rest is well worth listening to repeatedly. highly recommended ",positive

'at last you're mine' (fr.'heavenly bodies' sdtk 1985) 17. 'steppin' into the night' (fr.'armed & dangerous' sdtk 1986). the single version of 'got to be real' is fine because it includes cheryl's trademark soo-hoo soo-hoo vocal break that's absent on the longer album version. all in all i'd recommend this cd to anybody that wants the best cheryl lynn compilation but serious fans will want more!!

" the bloodshot gang knows how to have a good time! if you're into the whole alt.country thing you know that some of it is very sincere and serious (ie uncle tupelo jayhawks). now i love no depression and blue earth but this is an altogether different quadrant of alternative country known as militant honky tonk or just insurgent country. truth be told this incredible anniversary compilation does have some poignant serious numbers (rico bell's money to burn the texas rubies' blue diamond mine mike ireland's i'd like to) but for the most part these maniacs are not taking themselves or the world that seriously. you've got andre williams and sally timms singing i'll stick to you like glue... in mock romantic seriousness with background singers going g-l-e-u glue! you've got a song with a man and a woman serenading each other saying with deep country feeling how much they miss each other's bodies. you've got kim docter and moonshine willy belting out turn the lights down low which really ought to be a hit it's so catchy. and you've got some great deadpan covers -- the waco brothers do a country rave-up of the who's baba o'riley red star belgrade does it to ac/dc's highway to hell and best of all the unholy trio turns public enemy's bring the noise into an understated redneck anthem. i'm only scratching the surface here with 40 tracks over 2 discs. this is a great introduction to the rowdier side of that sprawling beast that has not a name that can be agreed on... and don't miss the fantastic earlier bloodshot compilation hell-bent (insurgent country volume ii) -- see my 9/5/04 review ",positive
" if you have never heard book of shadows by zakk wylde then you may be suprised by this album. the two albums are similiar in that they contain a lot more acoustic guitar and although i'm not saying that past releases have not contained emotion hm vi contains more. for example take 'she deserves a free ride' and the ballad 'fear'. the piano on this album is superb haunting at one point and almost relaxing at another. however there is just enough of past 'metal' bls in this album - 'crazy or high' and 'house of doom'. personal favourites are 'damage is done' 'layne' and 'queen of sorrow'. there is something more in the solo's - they come in at just the right time and as usual are perfectly executed - check out 'stepping stone' for an example. the musicianship has got even better on this album with the dodgy drums on 1919 eternal gone and the bass that was pushed to the background in the blessed hellride is up there with zakk's playing. this album is deep moving piece that is the perfect successor to the blistering blessed hellride. can't wait for the new mafia cd to be released.

" this album has some of the best country songs in the business. mark sings songs straight from his heart. there are songs for every occasion from the slow ballads like &quot;too cold at home&quot; &quot;i'll think of something else&quot; and &quot;almost goodbye&quot; to the fast heels kicking &quot;bubba shot the jukebox&quot; and &quot;going through the big 'd'&quot;. these songs are about real life realtionships and how they affect the heart. so if you're in the mood to cry about that lost love or smile now that they're gone this is the album for you ",positive

" this tribute was announced almost ten years ago and it seems to have undergone a transformation since then. to be fair there are some interesting additions such as the sufjan stevens and brad mehldau tracks. and emmylou harris is brilliant. but sarah mclachlan's blue has been heard before as has prince's a case of you. earlier reports indicated contributions from heaviweights like steely dan and lindsey buckingham. i sure would like to have heard what they would have done. even more disappointing is that joni's hejira-mingus era albums are mostly ignored - and that was her best music in my opinion. as a final indignity it sounds to me that too much compression was added in the mastering phase and hence the overall sound quality of the cd is lacking in dynamics.

" for any seasoned fans of the waifs (or anyone out there with a predilection for folksy girl duets sporting brilliant guitar skills and voices to boot) 'shelter me' will be no departure --and no disapointment -- from what you've heard before. the album weighs heavily on the waifs accoustical appeal. the majority of the songs carry themselves without backbeat or excessive instrumentation -- mostly it's just the girls their guitars and the usual typically wonderful songwriting that comes from josh cunningham the third member of this stellar folk ensemble. the title track 'shelter me' is a gorgeous magnificently charged piece that will leave you reeling take me now where shelter be/ before there's nothing left of me. vikki's final track 'spotlight' is a pure gem emotional and raw but utterly beautiful. 'attention' finishes the album well with that familliar waify energy and pulse almost blue grass almost country but totally wonderful. ",positive

" i'm a big fan of the boss but for the life of me can't fathom why he is unable to follow the lead of larger acts and actually unplug for mtv unplugged. this cd offers no new material that can't be found elsewhere and is basically nothing more than a live in concert cd that just so happened to be filmed by mtv. this concert took place in 1992 and you know it's pretty bad when you have bands ribbing you three years later about going on mtv unplugged and then having to go and plug in. it's not like bruce doesn't know how to play acoustic guitar because he does. i'm a big acoustic guitar fan and for someone of bruce's talent level to not be able to write songs that can be played acoustically only serves to bring down the level of respect i have for his talent. not what i would consider an essential recording and not recommended unless you are such a die-hard boss fan that you have to own every album he puts out. otherwise save your money ",negative

" 1990. it dosen't seem like that lond ago. when a barley known mariah carey stuns the world with a powerful 5 octave voice that hasen't been heard since minnie ripperton. she made her appearance when she signed on to columbia records after the now forgotten brenda k. starr whom mariah was a backup singer for at the time gave tommy mottola a demo tape of her songs and the rest was history. now about the album. the album starts off with her first single vision of love a powerful song that spent weeks atop the charts and made mariah a star. you can feel the suspence as mariah builds up to the bridge and gives the world their first hearing of her beautiful 5 octave voice. truly to this day still one of her best songs. there's got to be away changes pace from love to world issues that are still relevent today. this was released as a single in the u.k. (it wasn't released in the u.s. for fear that it would break her string of four number one hits) yet it failed to chart. someday is the next song and was the albums third single. it too hit number one in 1991. this song is great to hear after a breakup as mariah warns an ex-lover that the one you gave away will be the only one your looking for. this song may seem a little out dated now as it still has some heavy 80's synth beats. i don't want to cry was the albums fourth and in the u.s. the last release. it too hit number one in the summer of 1991 and within a year mariah had a whopping four number one hits under her belt. something that will not be accomplished for a long long time. though mariah has declared her hatred for the song as she fought over the production of the song and was dissatisfied with the final product the song still has all the work of a great mariah song and it is the only song that mariah does not hit her famous whistle register with. vanishing though never becoming a single is probably one of the best mariah recordings. a gospel like song with amazing vocals over a pounding piano is enough to make anyone think their in heaven. though the song is spookey enough at the chorus when she softly coos swiftly you're vanishing drifting away. it has also been called a hidden treasure by many reviewers. all in your mind is another song that realy showcase mariah's vocal capabilities. though this is one of the few songs that sound dated but definatly worth a listen. alone in love is a song that is soft and pleading would make anyone run back to mariah. truley a mariah great. the next two songsyou need me and sent up from above really are the weakest tracks on the album and do bring down the feel of the album. they also sound dated and are not the style in which mariah is famous for. still every mariah song is worth a listen so go for it! prisoner is a truley a great mariah tune. though this has a rock influence as well she does a great job with the vocals and the lyrics stay insode your head. this almost became a single in the u.s. but mariah finished her new album quicker than originaly planned. love takes time truly will have a place in my heart. every time i hear this song it takes me back to 1990 almost like a little time machine. putting this song on her first record almost didn't happen as mariah har intended it to be on her next record. though tommy mottola and other executives persuaded her to. the style is not that different than vision of love where it build untill the brige where mariah lets off her signature high note. this was also the second single of the album and became her second number one in late 1990. though music box daydream and the emancipation of mimi would go onto break records and are considered some of mariah's best albums there is no way you can leave this one out. this album truley is the one that started it all. to this date it has gone 9x platinum and made carey into a star and would be the start of years and years of great music from the voice of this generation. though this album was heavily criticized for being to similar and formulaic to paula abdul janet jackson and especially whitney houston it still ranks as one of the best albums of the 90's and of all time. for some people this album may be a time capsule of 1990 and for others who are now expiriencing this music for the first time one fact will always be true. this is one of the best debuts and albums ever and was the start of a simple long island girl named mariah carey who became a superstar.

" i purchased this cd with the intent of finding fine players playing fine music. what i found however was and outstanding example of chamber music as its finest. the ensemble these 3 players generate is some of the finest ensemble music playing recorded. each player displays exceptional technique both in the mechanical and lyrical aspects of their playing. most impressive is listening to istomen who playing a very technically and lyrically demanding part voices his playing with such finess and carefull attention to detail to the strings; a feat very difficult to do as a pianist. this is an excellent recording for the professional to study a score from or for the avid listener to play over and over ",positive

" martina mcbride's emotion album contains many pop country elements but is still nonetheless a great album. here's how i rate each song. (out of a 5 star scale) 1) do what you do- good song but takes a little to get used to. (4 stars) 2) anything's better than feeling the blues- good songs good lyrics. (4 stars) 3) i love you- great song martina's most successful song on the country charts spending 5 weeks in the top spot. (5 stars) 4) make me believe- great song about whether one's love is true or not.... i love the lyric but it's hard to start a fire without a spark (5 stars) 5) love's the only house- this song will draw a strong connection to your heart. the song is spectacular and speaks the truth... love is truly the only house big enough for all the world's pain. the video to this song is very touching as well. go martina! (5 stars) 6) there you are- a perfect wedding song... she hold the are note for at least 12+ seconds near the end. (5 stars) if you hear this song live she holds the note 15 seconds!!!! (so live this song will be 6 stars/5 stars!!!!) 7) it's my time- the first song that i ever heard martina perform live in the ama awards... she rocked the house down with this song... she also holds a 10 second note at this song. love that range of hers. (5 stars) 8) i ain't goin' nowhere- i like this song and its message about being there for a significant other. (5 stars) 9) anything and everything- the lyrics and martina's gentle vocal performance on this song are perfection. (5 stars) 10)from the ashes- another standout song on this album. she holds some high notes in this one too. (5 stars) 11) goodbye- a solid performance i llike how martina goes lower and softer in some parts of the song. (4 stars) 12) this uncivil war- the best song on the album!!!! amazing!!!! written by gretchen the writer of martina's career hit indepedence day. a very emotional song which defines the title of the album. the ending is a real treat as well. (6 stars!) this album is definitely worth purchasing!!! it helps complete my collection of martina's albums ",positive

" this might be the best cd that has come out this year. it may be will oldham's best cd since viva last blues. it may be better than viva last blues although these are two different styled cds. the letting go has a mostly very mellow sound. almost every song is beautiful. the string and guitar melodies are uplifting. will oldham's voice is grounding it is the familiar voice you have heard for the past decade or so. dawn mccarthy's voice will then again lift you up. mccarthy's voice is a fantastic companion to oldham's. other singers/bands have tried to use a female voice to echo or accompany the lead vocal and it has often become irritating. this is not the case with the letting go mccarthy's accompaniment adds so much to the album but without taking away from oldham. i haven't listened to a will oldham album since ease down the road. this makes me want to go back and listen to those albums i have missed. one song in particular the seedling (i believe) has a different sound than the rest of the album. it has a harsher sound but is still a good song. this is a great introduction if you are new to oldham or if you are returning listener.

" i am a hater to the core. i hate puffy and thats all it is to it. now there you don't have to say it.so on to the review. first off every lyrical line puffy spit in this album was outdone by everybody. every track he had the weakest flow and the worst rhymes. and thats the truth. i don't know how true this is but i heard loon was behind most of puffy's lines on this album. so that should explain the utter wackness in his lyrics. the truth is i don't care who writes his lines. it could be tupac and nas doin it since its not them spittin it then it actually takes away from the rhymes itself. almost this entire album is filler. the best tracks is real n**** and journey through my life. i really didn't feel that beat a whole lot but nas and beanie's verses was off the hook. however that is not enough for me to give this album more than one star. now i love mc lyte and public enemy but they should get smacked in the back of they heads with crowbars for lettin him mutilate their classics. thats not musical artistry thats butcher work. fake thug dedication really gets under my skin. the title alone. no disrespect to biggie as an artist cause i do like him still. but they put a diss on tupac on life after death after he died then denied it for years. so perhaps the fake thug dedication should be to him cause thats some sucker s***. i didn't hear his latest album i'm not going to review it i didn't even visit that section. if you a fan of this guy then you gon cop this and his new one regardless. if you like me and hate just about everything he puts out you won't be caught within a mile of that s*** ",negative
" stiff upper lip is a good ac/dc album it's not a great ac/dc album. it kills me when people say that ac/dc have sounded the same since 1973 on every album they have done. nothing could be further from the truth. i have always thought that each ac/dc album has a sound and a feel and a story in it's own and that a track off each album would be totally out of place on another album. for instance can you image shake a leg on stiff upper lip? or ballbreaker on back in black? it doesn't work. stiff upper lip has its own kind of rough bluesy feel to it. brian's voice sounds different the tones and the guitars sound different. it's good but not great. the standouts... 1. stiff upper lip- pretty rocking song. has a good attitude. it's fun. 2. hold me back and can't stand still. very odd rolling songs. they sound a lot alike. again these songs could never have been on back in black. i have heard that brian sang can't stand still in one take that's why they all clap at the end. i don't know if that's true but it's an interesting song. 3. satellite blues- this one is an instant classic. i love this song. this song could have been done back in the days of back in black and if it were on that album i think it would be as popular as you shook me all night long. everything else is ho hum. not good not bad. better than most bands out there. i am really hoping ac/dc put out a killer album with their new release whenever that is. i hope they don't turn into the new g&r and suffer from the chinese democracy syndrome ",positive

" just lay back and listen. brian wilson never misses a note. his voice was one of the natural wonders of sixties pop. his composing and arranging skills are without peer and he even plays some awesome bass (the slow middle eight section on &quot;wouldn't it be nice&quot;)on this album. these songs are the sound of former teen idols settling into adulthood and feeling both excited and uncertain. recorded with a large selection of musicians and sung heartbreakingly well by the beach boys themselves this is a true pop magnum opus. the best tracks are the gorgeous &quot;you still believe in me&quot; &quot;don't talk (put your head on my shoulder&quot;) the title cut and the tear inducing &quot;caroline no&quot;. instead of trapping you outside his pain and insecurity brian wilson invites you into his world and lays his soul bare with a suite of songs that haven't aged a day since 1966. the more you listen to &quot;pet sounds&quot; the more it's beauty envelopes you ",positive
" i am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this cd. we were barely able to make it through one listening. this is a classic example of a cd that never would have been produced had the artist (using the term very loosely) not already been famous for something besides music. the lack of talent and originality on this cd is apalling. it only gets a star because that's the lowest rating. i want my money back ",negative
" as a fan of both celtic traditional and bluegrass music i was wary of a cd claiming to be a hybrid - too often it means an unsatisfactory compromise where original flavours become watered down and insipid. i need not have worried - tim o'brien has produced one of the most amazing and rewarding musical journeys i've followed for some time. not only do the players from the two traditions blend instinctively and harmoniously but the tracks mostly songs are marvellous vehicles for new and exciting directions. there are superb performances all round vocally from o'brien with guests paul brady maura o'connell kathhy mattea del mccoury etc and musicians altan frankie gavin jerry douglas earl scruggs seamus egan and a host of others and the sound is fresh acoustic and vital requiring no production gimmicks or effects. standout songs for me personally are &quot;mountaineer is always free&quot; &quot;lost little children&quot; &quot;wandering&quot; and &quot;john riley&quot; although there is not a weak track on the cd. it is obvious that for tim o'brien this has been a labour of love. if you like acoustic music from any tradition either side of the atlantic you'll love it. several of my friends have bought it on my recommendation and agree it is brilliant ",positive
" like many amazon reviewers i play a teensy bit of guitar. i know just enough to know how incredible these guys are. this is the best most exciting acoustic playing i've heard since al dimeola cut race with devil on spanish highway on his elegant gypsy suite lp. watching the del castillo brothers shred on the dvd part of this set will assure that i don't get anywhere near my guitar for a long time. since robert rodriguez (desperado spy kids etc) filmed the performances we get appallingly good tight shots of the fretwork. people it can't be done. i will henceforth concentrate on harmonica and try to forget that sugar blue does about the same level of impossibility on that instrument. the songs and playing come from a somewhat traditional latin mexicano perspective but the overall sound is more like santana when carlos goes acoustic. the hidden track on the cd most overtly shows that the del castillo brothers love their blues and rock almost as much as the latin roots music. this is an obvious buy for anyone who enjoys latin music or great guitar work of any style but it is more accurate to say that anyone who is not totally averse to this style should check it out. the quality of music here really transcends the genre ",positive
" when i bought this cd it was for a little bit of nostalgia - those were the days. since playing it once when it blew me away with the tracks and the memories i have played it so often that if it were vinyl it would be worn out by now. if you liked mary hopkins then this is a fantastic selection of her music and well worth a place in your collection ",positive
" the afro-eurasian eclipse is a groundbreaking suite full of intriguing new sounds and grooves. ellington didn't fade into predictability and mundanity in his last years; instead his compositions became more and more original and exciting. this suite has rocking swinging waltzing grooves that though seemingly disparate work together and illustrate the theme stated in the duke's spoken introduction to the suite: to show that the whole world is going oriental and that no one will be able to retain his or her identity... not even the orientals. duke doesn't leave his standbys behind though. the phenomenal playing of ashby carney jones and the rest of the orchestra keeps the afro-eurasian eclipse firmly rooted in virtuosity even when playing to new grooves melded with african asian and australian rhythm and sound. on a personal note this is one of my favorite cds. aside from the remarkable music it gets bonus points for the spoken introduction at the beginning of the chinoiserie track. audio notes give the listener a greater understanding of the cd especially one with a single focus like this one.

" yeah johnny must've been drinking heavily during this recording. it's evident in his slurred lyrics...it's raining is the song where he sounds totally wasted although you can get the sense that he is infact quite happy and very relaxed. but all this inebriation actually adds to the authenticity of this c.d.---- johnny winter really becomes the archetypal bluesman on this c.d. his guitar work is quite sparse no long solos on this one but nevertheless the feel on this album is wonderful. i have to say this also..johnny must've been very very brave to release this album back in 1977. that was a very bad year for the blues appalling infact...disco music was king. alot of bluesmen like johnny guitar watson etc were opting for the commercialism of the disco dance floor. johnny might've thought of releasing a commercial type rock album like edgar was doing. instead he chose to stay faithful to the blues and i have to admire the determination and resolve of johnny winter. very few would've stayed faithful to the blues. the last track with muddy waters ..walking thru the park...captures johnny in his element. he was so happy back then and it filters over into the song itself. i remember seeing them both do this song live at the capitol radio festival alexander palace london/england in july 1977. never again to be repeated sadly ",positive
" when john cipollina was in the lineup and he and rhythm guitarist gary duncan were in the groove there was no better sounding group than qms. cipollina's talent was awe inspiring. unfortunately one of quicksilver's overbearing and domineering members ways led to cipollina's departure. without cipollina qms sounded like just another mediocre rock group despite the talents of duncan freiberg and elmore. i saw them at the hollywood palladium 33 years ago and can verify this.if you want to hear them at their best buy the 1st album happy trails or lost gold and silver ",negative

" as one of the founding fathers of today's heavy metal rock music iron butterfly has them power drive and sound that made them unique in the world of rock music. this live album serves as a testament to that fact. eventhough the recordings of live concerts from the late 1960's through the mid 1980's was primative at best (by today's standards) this live recording of iron butterfly captures most of the groups best music durring their prime as a chart-topping group of that era. this is a must-have for all iron butterfly fans ",positive

" fluke's latest album had been long in coming and plagued with issues (word on the grapevine is one of the trend-setting trio left some point during production). still years after their masterpiece risotto fluke has returned intact and delivered another album the oddly titled puppy. puppy is for the most part a dark album. it's clearly the evolution of the track absurd (off risotto) and its particular taste of big beat techno with numerous tracks featuring similarly styled lyrics and vocals. the sound has been expanded with touches of industrial guitars and beats that would sound right at home in prodigy's fat of the land or at a nine inch nails concert. the opening snapshot shows this most evidently. the album takes up a rave feel with the tracks another kind of blues (a remix of the stellar number zion featured in the matrix reloaded and its soundtrack) and hang tough which flow into each other and result in a mesh of old-school rave beats with new-school industrial grooves. ykk is a wicked track that would easily be at home in a big-budget spy or action flick while expo is a sweeping and epic song. blue sky is as close to an uplifting number you'll find on the cd with a full choir used in the song's chorus. compared to risotto puppy inevitably comes up short. like bt's emotional technology puppy has the misfortune of being the follow-up album to a complete and utter masterpiece (puppy to risotto emotional technology to movement in still life). and let's face it: it's hard to surpass yourself when release an album that's nigh-perfect. still i wasn't sure what to expect with puppy and i found myself pleasantly surprised. it's darker and meaner but it's an overall rock-solid album and fans of the grittier side of fluke (absurd atom bomb) will likely be pleased with puppy ",positive

" actually haven't heard this cd yet i can still comment on part of it. i was the lucky guy who did the live recording at the x-ray cafe. sold the masters to the band a couple years ago and just now got around to thinking i wonder if they ever did anything with those masters? so i was there at the show and can say that every ounce of energy that the band put out (which was considerable since this was the last show on their tour but they knew the x-ray was special and gave it their all)- it was all captured on these recordings. the machine was a tascam 688 that used standard cassette tapes for 8-channel recordings. most all the mics were either shure sm57/58 but there was also a high quality shure stereo mic overhead that was mainly used for capturing the drum kit but also provided a nice stereo image of the stage. the x-ray was perfect for this type of recording. the tiny pa was only used for the vocals so there was no competing with a pa blasting everything. i would place a sm-57 close to every amp. had a nice specialtiy bass mic too. usually 8 channels was enough to catch everything but there were extra inputs where it was possible to stack multiple mics onto a single track if needed. because of the overhead stereo catching the drums this was rarely needed. with a full house such as the night with the gits any reflecting waves were just soaked up by the body mass of the crowd creating what turned out to be a very nice intimate recording space. there was split box on stage which fed all the mics to the x-ray business office next door which is where the tascam was setup away from any real danger. all of which made it a fun gig to record in comfort and be able to also go over to the stage side and enjoy the show. every once in a while magic happened. d. fletcher portland or ",positive
" this album is a real let down and it pains me to say so since i really do like the kol. the first 2 cds were catchy and they rocked. i didn't care if they were singing about groupie sex or street brawling. it didn't matter because the songs were great.but on this cd they've opted for an experimental sound that doesn't measure up. innovative is one thing but that shrill screech in charmer-what the heck is up with that? how often do you want to listen to it? once was enough for me. i wasn't expecting the pixies here. and then there's the reverb employed on song after song-why? it just degenerates into white noise. there are a couple of good tracks on the dics- black thumbnail for one. but then there are throwaway tunes like camaro which is about as clique as you can get. that said art is subjective and there are obviously plenty of folks who feel compelled to give this cd glowing reviews. but i find most of it unlistenable.i can think of many cds that merit a 5 star rating; this is definitely not one of them ",negative
" i feel bad doing this becuase i love iggy and the stooges but the quality on this set is pretty bad. all the live recordings are worth listening to and probably owning but the quality is very rough and can get frustrating. it's like the first beatles anthology set: the material is amazing but the quality is bad. on the plus side the studio outtakes are decent quality wise and amazing content wise. the packaging is also very nice. i just though i'd share this information before you drop all the money on the set. if you are a stooges fan don't hesitate purchase now but if this is your introduction you should probably wait.

" the music contained trout mask replica is some of the most unique acid-drenched art to ever be pressed. the songs on the album are mainly divided into folkish a capella tunes and the crazed jams the captain and his band are known for. several strange unconventional themes are visited and revisted throughout the track list such as bulbs gingham trout and a variety of other surreal sensously described wildlife. however if there's any reason to buy captain beefheart's trout mask replica it's to listen to the album as a whole. i find it difficult to listen to any other way. while i find this to be true i do have favorites that i go to when introducing friends to the captain or simply jamming out to without dedicating myself to the full experience: ella guru dachaus blues dust blows forward neone meat dream and old fart at play stick out ",positive
" this mix starts off heavy and never lets up with the quirky yet hard hitting vocal track grace (anxiety) by troy pierce (as louderbach) starting things off in a very energetic way. this track worked well in sascha funke's boogy bytes 2 mix but it was deep into the mix. i feel it's even more effective starting a mix off. things quickly lighten up with the bloopy claude vonstroke next and then it's into the m.a.n.d.y. remix of tiefschwarz's excellent track damage featuring tracey thorn of everything but the girl on vocals. two solid tech house tracks follow especially touane's snappy track bassic and it's right into the gritty churning techno sound of thomas schumacher's incredible track rotor. the mix then hits a very slight snag in track 7 which i feel is one of only two so-so parts of the mix. it's not bad it's just a little too light and bubbly tech house for my liking. it's quickly forgotten as the mix races through with 4 solid tracks in a row and right after the melodic freefall it's into tiefschwarz's own remix of a depeche mode track. this is the only other slight miss in the mix for me as i feel the track was a tad too long at nearly 7 minutes and could have been trimmed to better fit the flow of the mix. another solid melodic track is next and we end with the dubbed out vocals of kate wax. overall it's an exciting tech house mix that's a full lineup of solid tracks with not a bad one in sight and very few dips in the scorching pace of one very sound top to bottom mix. do not miss picking this one up as it's easily in the top 5 techno/tech house mixes this year ",positive

" i honestly feel that tesla reached the end here. after psychotic supper failed to get the label support that it desparately needed the group just fell apart. with this the whole metal scene was falling away anyhow as grunge was dying off after the death of kurt cobain and here was tesla trying to make up it's mind what way to go. with the opening track the gate it sounded like they were going to head back to the hair days of the 80's but then the next song solution they played like a lost and wandering band of the 90's. the rest of the songs just followed suit. the groups slogan is no machines but there's also another slogan at foot here and that's no music direction and for some bands that's possibly a workable concept as long as there's an inkling of where the bands roots are. with tesla it's all over the board where they would score a top 10 hit with an acoustic version of the song signs which is a rock song to where they do a cover here of joe south's games people play. i feel that tesla failed to show thier influences here and was just trying to make a living; which is not a bad thing but it pretty much kept them at a cult status. i pretty much had this album but didn't listen to it at the time as i was trying to leave the secular music scene behind and just move onto christianity and i know the album lurked around in my head all this time so i felt it was time to face it; i feel that the album is below par for a group that can do some memorable songs and to me it seems they wanted out of the label and possibly away from each other.

" following the demise of soundgarden in 1997 everyone was curious what chris cornell would do next. would he immerse himself in another band where he could display his blood-curdling screams or would he surprise everyone with something totally different? he chose the latter. with natasha shneider on keys and alain johannes on guitars cornell found the opportunity to break away from his heavily zeppelin and sabbath-rooted musical background and he also asked some other musicians to make an appearance on the record. the result is a very diverse album highlighting cornell's immediately identifiable vocals and relatively more simpler songwriting. that said he had the chance to incorporate a multitude of other instruments including tambourine theremin and timpani. besides the trademark blues rock-ridden songs that helped cornell make a name for himself he also digs deep into psychedelia best heard on preaching the end of the world a song that finds cornell opting for thick radiohead-like arrangements lofty acoustics and a strange mix of keyboard and guitar effects. not too different is disappearing one guesting soundgarden drummer matt cameron with its moving vocal melodies shimmering keyboards and even a vague clarinet addition. surely soundgarden fans expecting a very heavy record with meaty guitars and lots of aggressive vocals will be sorely disappointed. but they need to realize euphoria morning was meant to be different way before cornell started working on it. solo projects serve the purpose of letting the artists express themselves in ways they are unable to in their own bands. and considering this euphoria morning is a huge success. that said there are still some songs where the band behind cornell churns out some rocking riffs and rhythms such as flutter girl and especially pillow of your bones during the chorus. the former starts out in an almost poppy fashion but quickly picks up a playful funk bass line and is finished off with a cool blues lead; whereas the latter is more straightforward employing lots of acoustic and electric guitars as well as weird percussion work. the final song steel rain is also a number that alternates between decidedly heavier parts and more haunting ominous moments. the ethnic drumming (great tabla rhythms) on this track is quite experimental given cornell's music with soundgarden and later on with audioslave. follow my way and when i'm down are the most moving songs with the latter featuring a deft piano and organ melody beneath cornell's heartfelt delivery. this is another song that embraces his love for bluesy guitar work and it also features some female backing harmonies during its pre-chorus. similarly the title track is a passionate piece where cornell sings entirely a capella over acoustic guitars. there are no other instruments; cornell plays his guitar and simply sings his heart out. a remix of the effect-laden mission would later be included on the mission impossible 2 soundtrack while moonchild became a minor hit with its eerie atmosphere along with the opening song can't change me perhaps the most modern-sounding upbeat song on the album. despite being only three minutes though its flow is majestic borrowing harmonica tambourine and shimmering keyboards that climax at the final second. my european copy of the album contains a very different version of the opening song with french lyrics accordion mandolin and female vocals backing cornell. the song returns to its english chorus at one point but the rest is all delivered in french and perhaps more engaging than the original version in some ways. chris cornell is one of the greatest voices in rock and this solo album is testimony to his greatness. when freed from any band restrictions the man is capable of crafting some of the most moving and brutally honest songs ever.

" basie's best players come to duke's place the columbia records 30th street studios in 1961 and face ellington's finest. not a battle but not quite a merger either since the count's contingent is heard in one speaker and their hosts in another channel. there's more than an hour of good music on here laid down in the dying days of big jazz touring orchestras. popular tastes had changed and the costs of keeping large groups of players together were impossible. this is one of those rare cd's in which the booklet is almost as good as the music. this one reveals that during this 12-hour late-afternoon-to-early-morning session one of ellington's long-time employees quit the group forever because the boss would not take his side in a fight with a colleague. also interesting is the dispute over the title and cover graphics. basie hated columbia's first idea to bill the date as a competition and his agent even destroyed the only copy of the original cover art. the end result is an album whose sales over 40 years have been hurt because no one knows its name. the cover finally chosen says the count meets the duke but in larger letters it declares first time! and then adds 2 great orchestras and finally states duke ellington and count basie. the label columbia/sony put on the disc itself for this reissue says duke ellington meets count basie which makes no sense because they had known each other since the 20's. if you already like both orchestras you'll want to own this late career session. if you want an introduction to each group in its waning years the cd serves nicely for that too. this disc really jives so don't be expecting any ballads here ",positive

" i had high hopes for this cd. i love norwegian metal and i love viking stuff so i thought this would be great. i was at least hoping it would be good. what i heard was a bunch of uninspired mediocre a dime a dozen metal songs. i mean there is enough good to save it from being a total waste but not enough to give it even 3 stars. the high points are the fate of norns the persuit of vikings and arson. these songs are bad @$$ and fun to listen too. an ancient sign of coming storm 5.5 just mediocre where death seems to dwell 5.5 very repetitive the fate of norns 7 this one is pretty good. it has a repetitive punchy opening riff that gets stuck in your head long after listening to it. the pursuit of vikings 7.5 this is my favorite song from this cd. pretty bad a$$. valkyries ride 5.5 tedious monotony the beheading of a king 5.5 same as valkryies arson 7.5 a bit of a slow starter but it picks up towards the end with some melodic guitar once sealed in blood 5.5 a bit faster than some but still a downer. all in all nothing horrible and there is some good songs. the music is a little on the simple side which doesnt necasarily make it bad. i like a lot of simpler music like darkthrone and burzum. the problem is that when it comes to simpler stuff i like it to have some really good aptmosphere. that is precisly what is lacking here. i will still listen to it occasionally hoping that it will grow.

" i have *not* listened to this album in full. i am however completely turned off by the fidelity of all the samples i have just listened to. there's no excuse for an album sounding that bad in '69. ghad there was zeppelin hendrix clapton miles - who recorded this thing? all musicians on this cd are superlative examples of their mastery of their instruments but the above reviewers in general are correct. holdsworth made lifetime along with tony william's kick-ass drumming and most probably insisted - perfectionist that he was and still is - that it *sounded* like something other than a bootleg. personally i'd regard this as something a collector should have - it's for a devotee not for someone trying to access the genre for the first time because the fidelity is just darn terrible - and one of the above reviewers is so correct. it's like dylan looking for his girl from the north country or knocking on heaven's door. at least they let tony williams in so he wouldn't sing any more! all gags aside a dissapointing effort. overpriced but one to have if you are a collector. you have to strain to hear the seed of what was to become holdsworth's version of lifetime which i have not forgotten for 30 plus years. a quantum difference in fidelity and quality of music. i'd rather buy tony william's lifetime collection if i had to make the choice. i'd be tempted to pick this one up on peer to peer if i was desperate... very unimpressed ",negative

" when it comes to big star's 70's output you can call me a hopeless fanboy because after listening to in space it seems that only a hopeless fanboy would think that thirty-some-years later exactly one-half of the classic big star lineup could---or in forever difficult alex chilton's case would be so inclined---to attempt to recapture the lightning-in-a-bottle transcedent pop magic that made those 70s discs so great. this disc has way more in common with chilton's oft-times difficult mostly self-indulgent solo work than with any of big star's previous fascinating pop near-perfection. while i'll admit that i have enjoyed a good chunk of chilton's solo work (in a slightly guilty rolling-my-eyes oh...that alex! sorta way...) my musical sensibilities are somehow offended by the fact that this group and that this particular collection of songs are presented as big star. in space is connected musically to the original big star by little more than the fact that two of the same guys in this band were in that band. if you don't expect much you won't be disappointed.

" being quite the fan of grace slick jefferson airplane and other 60s groups i bought this album only having heard two songs on it--daydream nightmare and outlaw blues. at first i was a little puzzled--the great society sounded different than any band i'd ever heard before. after listening to it about two more times i realized this uniqueness was a good thing! they sound a little rougher than your average 60s band and they were--grace her first husband and her brother-in-law assembled this band out of a few of their friends and it only was around for about a year. the great society definitely isn't a band for everyone but if you love interesting-sounding music want to hear some of the earlier forms of psychedelic rock or are just curious about how grace slick sounded before the *smoother* recordings of jefferson airplane this is the band for you! a quick review of all the songs: sally go 'round the roses: a great way to open this cd. pay special attention to the instrumental break in the middle--it's amazing! (any time this group does an instrumental solo it will be very good.) didn't think so: in my opinion one of the weaker songs on this album but a fine song just the same. grimly forming: an overall fantastic song to listen to with intriguing lyrics and another great instrumental section. (i love the tambourine--it adds an interesting air to the song.) somebody to love: yes here it is--the original version of the jefferson airplane hit written by darby slick grace's brother-in-law. this has a much less *psychedelic* sound than the ja version but they're both equally as good. father bruce: this is a very catchy song written about lenny bruce as if he were a preacher. fun to sing along with. outlaw blues: this is a cover of a bob dylan song i think. grace's voice on this is incredible. often as i may: another fun song that's almost as catchy as father bruce. arbitration: this song is mostly some great instrumentals but features some singing from david minor (he did rhythm guitar i believe.) white rabbit: yup another original version of a ja song! this song's about 6:20 because there are 4 minutes of great guitar/sax playing at the beginning. almost better than the ja version! that's how it is: a cheery song with fun words. you'll definitely be singing this one aftewards. darkly smiling: this is another weak link on the cd. (there aren't many thankfully!) it does have some interesting lyrics though. nature boy: grace's singing/recorder playing make this song memorable. you can't cry: this is a fun rock song with the usual great guitar playing from darby slick. daydream nightmare: this is one of the more *psychedelic* and dark songs on the album with great bass and guitar playing and more of grace's recorder. this is definitely not a song to skip over. everybody knows: also a fun rock song and yes another catchy one. born to be burned: this song is a little less exceptional but it does have a good bass line and some good guitar. father: a fantastic way to end the album! this song is a nearly-seven minute long instrumental that builds up to an amazingly frantic crescendo. not a song that will keep you bored ",positive

" mcmurtrys new album really disappoints. i am a longtime fan and found the subject matter of the new album slipping out of character with james past work (as well as somewhat inappropriate and overly cynical). while mcmurtry has had past hits that either hearken back to childhood extravaganza (see the elephant) or that provide an echo to the way we americans spend our time (holiday) his attempts on childish things came across as an unfortunate mix of trite and depressing. in past attempts mcmurtry was able to find the nuances of the positive and the negative of americana yet all the remains in the stinging lyrics of this album is the over-used and overheard downside. the thoughtfulness evaporated on this work. like many aging musicians mcmurtry could not resist the tempation to jump into personal politics to replace the vacuum of meaningful verse. the cliche and empty we cant make it here is a meaningless mix of 70s era socialism and the ills of modern era entitlement policies that displays an ignorance of both democracy and personal responsibility. mcmurtry previously able to frame an issue seems oblivious that those of different political persuasions could easily fit the same song title to a wholly opposed set of social ills. criticism is not intelligence and we can only hope that mcmurtry can get on track going forward. perhaps he should shun the pc crowd and seek his own space and more thoughtful views of the complex but substantial american scene for his next album ",negative
" la grange is probably at the top of most zz top fans lists and rightly so as it is superb but the version contained on this collection is the one where they did some weird digital reverb stuff to the drum track which completely destroyed the roadhouse vibe of the original recording. it is so awful that i don't know how anybody can listen to it. thankfully they got smart and went back to the original for rancho texicano. clueless classic rock stations are still playing the version contained here dummies. also waitin' on the bus/jesus just left chicago are two absolutely essential tracks that are inexplicably missing here ",negative

" in this cd laura pausini performs songs from a variety of italian singer-songwriters. she ads her personal touch to all of them of course. the results are lovely and inspired. a lot of the songs already had versions in castellano but laura and her team have written new spanish lyrics to some of them. all of these songs were made famous by their creators. most of the songs are ballads but there are some midtempo tracks in the title track dos (due by raf) and estrella gemela (by eros ramazzotti) and danceable pop in mi banda toca rock. i don't know about the comment from the reviewers below about mi banda toca rock as menudo song (a horrible thought to some of us!) but the original italian version was fun. it's not a bubblegum song but about the combination of traditional latin music (latin in the original sense all the musical varieties of romance-language speakers) and rock music something that was starting to happen when the song was written. this reminds me that someone was commenting that one of the songs had some sections in english. i believe they are wrong about the song. estrella gemela has some sections in english but that is the way it was originally written and performed by eros ramazzotti (in italian and spanish) to emphasize the influence of african-american gospel music in the song. laura also references this influence by using gospel chords at the start of the song. all in all this is a great album so give it a shot. whether you speak the language or not the italian version of the album is even better. laura just keeps getting better with time! laura sei bravissima ",positive
" reviewgium - volume i issue xvii over sixty and still going strong neil young has released a new album largely politcal and essentially a focused attack on u.s. president george w. bush. as opposed to his last album which was a more bittersweet country-tinged effort living with war is a pretty much straightforward rock album mostly electric with a background choir featured on many tracks as well as an unusually predominant trumpet player on several tracks. musically it's nothing spectacular in fact every song more or less follows the same tired formula and there are really no diversions from the grunge-like rhythm guitar chords. but the album is obviously intended to have a major focus on the vocals and lyrics. of course many people do not like neil young's vocals but there are many well-developed choral passages throughout the album including a soulful a capella arrangement of america the beautiful which closes the album. so basically i feel the vocal performances compensate--though not totally--for the lack of musical diversity. lyrically the album is pretty blatant; it could almost be a 60's protest album. but underlying that is a ray of hope and an urge to change our country for the better. there are a few decent tracks on the album even if they are not exactly mind-blowing (not that neil young was ever a showboater). after the garden is actually quite a good song as is shock and awe. flags of freedom is a bit of an upper so i can probably call that the album highlight though i'm sure the more politically-minded citizen will enjoy let's impeach the president an almost humorous overview of bush's faltering standpoints. the final three songs divert from the general theme of dismay and protest and offer feelings of hope and introspection. if you are not a fan of neil young you'll find nothing here that will convert you so you may just want to leave this on the shelf. if you are anti-bush you might get a buzz off of the lyrical aspect but that's probably the only thrill you will get. i tend to avoid anything political so music aside this album's message does not really appeal to me. it's like yeah people hate the president blah blah blah we know...give it a rest. for fans of neil i wouldn't exactly say you're not missing anything by avoiding this album; there is some good stuff on there but you might want to wait until you see it cheap in the used bin at your local cd shop. and for those interested this is not a crazy horse album.

" sounds like the background music used in the 70's rockford files tv crime show...and a little like the chips music too. similar to music by tom scott from back then. the crusaders never really get hard funky or dirty funky they are more smooth groovin funk. the sound for the times is very clean too produced for true funkyness. don't get me wrong i like the old 60's jazz crusaders just not this 70's phase of their career...they sold out to a large extent and continue to do so it's where the money is. no improvisatory feel either. this is for smooth jazz lovers. hard funk lovers will be disappointed as will true jazzers. i wish the crusaders kept their jazz chops from the 60's but they keep burying it like it never happened even to this day afraid to lose sales if they get too musically adverturous like their mid/late 60's true jazz albums. their 70's albums like this are partly to blame for today's smooth jazz... in other words not really jazz not really funky just kind of smooth groovin more for casual adults and offices. not challenging not offensive formulated to an extent. but hey if you like this that's cool just dont think it's real jazz or real funk. it's smooth and casual slightly simmers pleasant background music but doesn't cook like so many other groups from the same time period that mixed jazz funk and fusion. it just sounds like they are holding back...i know they can play more advanced and write more creatively they just choose not to ever since the 60's ",negative

" poison the well are one of those bands that i was really big on right when i first started listening to them but which faded a lot pretty quickly. i can't really say why. i like their work but it doesn't inspire me the way it used to. still i do like them and this album particularly. maybe not as much as opposite of december but whatever. yes this isn't as 'hardcore' as their older stuff but i've never been hardcore kiddie. (i'm a metalhead) and frankly being a modern hardcore band ain't much of a compliment in my book. it's funny lotsa tech-metalcore and other 'core derived bands are good but most straight hardcore/metalcore is staggeringly boring. so while old ptw was semi-technical metalcore this album is pretty much just extremely loud emo. but they now how to be 'emotional' and not come across as sissies(well most of the time) and jeff doesn't sing in an unbearably affected manner. course the 'extremely loud' part helps a lot too and jeff's growls/screams are absolutely devastating. way better than on their previous albums and some of the best extreme vox from anyone ever. as an extremely heavy emo album the instrumentation here is pretty bland. there isn't much real riffing going on not in the metal sense anyway mostly just a single note/chord repeated a great many times than another one etc. but the vox and atmospherics carry the day. the standout track is 'crystal lake' an absolutely bestial piece of deathcore. i've listened to quite a bit of death metal in my day but this has got to be one of the most devastating tracks i've ever heard largely because of the absolutely impassioned vox. lotsa extreme vox lack emotion but never moeria's (probably spelling that wrong sorry) that and the instruments are more noteworthy very nasty and chaotic. also it earns points for taking some of the seriousness out the genre with its jokey lyrics. (for the culturally backward this song is a first-person narrative from jason voorhees killer of most of the 'friday the 13th' films. hence the name 'crystal lake'.) there are no truly weak tracks here. 'ghostchant' is a good opener nicely displaying the extreme tonal dichotomy of the album mixing the fierce screams with some nice melodic vox. 'loved ones' is one of the very best tracks again carried almost entirely by the powerful vox. tracks 5 is a cool two part thing mixing the rather pleasant harmonica and bass driven intro with one of the more hectic grinding main songs. the album takes a turn for the lighter at about track 8. 'apathy is a cold body' is a very emo-y track but it's got a lot of nice melody to it so it works. 'sound like the end of the world' is another strange one. it's a slow doomy piece with oppressive atmosphere and a thick layering of vocal lines. not the best thing here but it works and it earns some points for being different. yes a solid if not great album. check it out ",positive
" this is one of my favorites of 2004. you got a seasoned vet of an mc rockin over some of the illest producers in underground hip hops beats(madlib j-zone dangermouse) and some pretty nice guest appearances. i have a couple of complaints on this album though like the song love thang the hook is wack and the beat is corny another wack hook comes thru on the title track where you got prince po sounding like tonto from lone ranger chanting some indian ish and on top of that in his rhyme he says some sh*t like and if the girl farts then she's a pooter??? thats dumb. one last complaint then i'm done hatin but the chorus on bump bump is terrible and i'm embarrased to bump bump that ish when i'm in my car because it sounds so wack but raekwon's verse takes me back to when wu tang was the untouchable squad they were back in the mid 90's which more than makes up for the lackluster chorus. aside from those complaints you got a dope album j-zone hit this up with some of best beats i've ever heard from him. so pick this up its definitely a good purchase ",positive

" or in their entire career for that matter. i have tried to like this band but greg dulli just won't shut up. every song is his snide lyrical diatribing on and on and on. the guitarist keeps things mildly interesting but on this album in particular the drummer also won't shut up and play a straight beat for once. it's like three guys in their own worlds and they mash it together and call what they've done songs. except for the one decent song they did the only rock song i can think of that is hard psychedelic passionate powerful and set to a waltz beat of all things. let me lie to you is the best song they ever made because everyone in the band is given room to breathe by the song's framework and tempo. instead of piling in on top of each other till the end of the song like they usually seem to do everyone agrees to hold back until the rushing choruses and it's less muddled and better orchestrated for it. it's a shame they didn't do any other songs like this at least none that i have heard. i tried to like them i really did. i wanted to find the band that made that one song and discover a whole treasure chest of dark passionate noisy music like that. too bad no wonder they drifted apart ",negative

" coming from a listener with a broad scope of musical preferences blues has always been a multi-faceted genre which can be broken down into the categories:soulful blues drinking blues and guitar blues. b.b king - live at the regal is one of those recordings that just happens to capture all three. this recording is dear to my heart as i can remember far back as first or second grade when my grandmother (god bless) used to play this on 8-track. she used to love herself some riley blues brother king. this recording always seemed to be in the player when my cousins and i would come over to visit and rest assured you will hear it before you left to go home. at that time being the young naive kid that i was i remember saying that i hated it and that it was old folks music. all grown up now in an age where real music is practically unheard of in terms of what these young artists of today release on cds i have a newfound respect for real stuff like this. so instead of sitting around burning your brain cells trying to understand what this new generation is calling itself creating you have decided to come to one of the first sources for good old fasioned real music....the blues. in my opinion bb king live at the regal is one of mr. king's best recordings and with myself not being a big fan of live albums this is one of those rare live pieces that captures the essence of what a live recording should sound like. maybe not so much in terms of the musicianship but the overall performance of those involved. the arrangements were put together nicely & the musicians were all in a very tight vibe on this album and whoever was on the mixing board did an excellent job of capturing this essence. bb's pickin' and crooning mixed with the superb playing by the band make this a wonderful place to start for the blues or bb king enthusiast. it sounds as if it was made in a tasteful nightclub full of grown people who wanted to hear good music while having a good time. the ladies were screaming and the gentlemen were cheering and bb was playing at his best. the only gripe i have about this disc is that it is very short; which was typical considering the age and time that it was made but still essential and a solid lesson for anyone interested in blues (especially blues guitar). i recommend getting this and bb's live in cook county jail. they both are live albums and both have some of the same songs on them but they were done in a different way and should still be heard. good choice if you get this one.

" um. i have nothing against bands that are mainstream. that has nothing to do with their quality of sound. (granted many mainstream bands are horrible but they all deserve a chance no?) dave though he has never impressed me. not that he's awful i suppose it's okay background music...better than nothing. just oh so mediocre. i don't understand why is he so highly praised? voice-wise? eh. nothing special. lyrics? hah! music? umm... bland? it's all the same! maybe i'm missing something? if you like one of dave's songs then by all means buy this! you can be sure your money will be spent on nearly exact replicas of that song. two stars because it's at least music. but that's on the high side considering how static it is. dave will never find a place in my cd player or in my computer.

" amazingly this compilation has managed to get together some of the most untallented performances of brahms' music. with a few exceptions the moto of this cd can be summed up as 'no understanding and appreciation for a musical genius'. the choice of music is also quite perfunctory. there are many brahms pieces that could have served better the bedtime purpose. buy at your own risk. my only fear is that some people will get their first impressions of brahms from this cd..

" what can you say about mfl that hasn't already been said. sublime perfect classic. this is still the definitive recording of the show and no one has ever come close to the original cast. sadly while the movie is wonderful had warner bros. used andrew's it might have been one of the greatest film musicals of all time. and while audrey hepburn gamely gives it her all andrew's had clearly made eliza doolittle her own and she would have been uncomparable on film and raised the level of the entire movie. well the rest is history andrews went on to be one of the biggest movie stars of the 60's. still probably the best example of a play being adapted into a musical. as george bernard shaw said (when he finally gave in and saw it during it's london run) i don't know where shaw ends and lerner and lowe begins.

" in the past i used to distance myself from certain rock genres because of a bad first experience. i'd be introduced to band not like it and claim the entire genre as being 'not for me'. the forecast however has changed how i feel. i personally love a heartfelt emo record just as much as the next guy but only because i was introduced to jimmy eat world and spitalfield a couple of years back. those bands allowed me to embrace the entire genre as a whole and expand my emo knowledge. imagine though if you will that i was new to emo. you in theory hand me a copy of late night conversations and tell me to listen. of course i hate it and lose any interest i may have had in the genre. to make a long story short the only good that came out of 'late night conversations' (an underproduced generic stale piece of s**t) was the revelation that came post-listen. never judge an entire genre by the first or second band you're introduced to (from said entire genre). not every metal band is iron maden. not every punk-pop band is blink 182. not every nu-metal band is linkin park. not every 'emo' band is jimmy eat world. every aspect of music has it's ups and downs and the forecast is clearly one of the downs. now that i've bored you with an entire rant about nothing i'd like you to pass on 'late night conversations'. with your help the forecast won't sell another record and in turn leave the scene forever. not recommended duh ",negative

" at no point in my following review am i by any means intentionally downing hank jr. i am just trying to give an honest review of this cd. at the time this album was realeased hank jr. was riding high winning big at the cma's and acm's. he was also releasing some of the most critically aclaimed country records of his recording career. but then for some reason he decided he needed to record some rock and roll. to me this cd is a studio recorded version of a hank williams jr. live concert. the only difference is he didn't botch the vocals as he does on his live show. the music is decidedly 80% not country it drifts towards eighties rock. if you trace hank jr.'s recording career you can point at this cd at the one that started the downward spiral that he has only began to pull himself out of. i must say though this cd contains one of hanks last top 10 hits if the south woulda won which is an hard to find recording on his compilations. i'd say this cd is kinda essential collecion wise just because of that song.

" as much as it pains me to say it this live cd is not a worthy billy joel release. in fact one wonders why it was released at all. billy's voice is strained and is prone to over singing and the arrangements are overblown. from the sound of things billy sounds like he was drunk or on medication. a lot of the running time is waisted with lengthy monologues with the audience. why this was put on the cd is anyones guess but it just neans less songs! however the good news is that this cd has now been blown away by his superb new 12 gardens cd in which billy is the billy of old. the one who sung well and sung the songs straight as they were meant to be sung. 12 gardens is crammed with 32 songs rather than the 26 on offer here and there's no timewaisting audience chat!!

" in many ways this album is everything one would have expected-- somehow the natural successor to no pussyfooting and evening star. in other ways its nothing like i would have expected-- the usual stamps of fripp and eno's recent work seems to be missing. its really quite hard to largely identify the identity of the musician generating the sound on much of this material there's obvious stuff (we'll come to that in a minute) but as a rule the backgrounds could be either of them. sonically it moves through a number of backdrops with delicate percussive synthish loops dominating the early part of the record (meissa lyra tarazed) wheras the middle of the record feels more like their old collaborations updated the sort of modern fripp soundscapes being more apparent (lupus ankaa). the remainder of the album features on track that is totally unexpected the downright funky altair with its train shuffling rhythms drum loops and funky guitar (in ways similar to material from the eno/schwaum drawn from life record) and the closer terebellum is an aggressive haunting and almost angry sounding piece almost reminiscent of radiophonics or the other more aggressive soundscapes. over this material fripp largely solos using a variant of his legendary fuzz tone-- its a bit mellower and rounder though similar to his leads on starless and the power to believe part ii but in a more hushed feel. so that tells not much the real question is what's it like? largely an ambient affair the collaboration is what you'd expect-- there's no real incindiery moments here-- don't look for a baby's on fire but it is comparable to their previous collaborations in quality and it certainly sounds nothing like crimson. some of it is full of delicate beauty (lyra) some of its just a blast (altair) some of its actually quite hard to listen to at all (terebellum). for fans of ambient music especially the work of these two gentelemen this one will be quite rewarding. it falls short somehow of being a masterpiece but it is really a great record. recommended ",positive

" five stars may be excessive if you judge this cd alongside the greatest classics but when compared to similar cds within the singer-songwriter folk-rock genre this beautifully simple and powerful collection really shines. i find myself coming back to this cd more often than to many better-known classics because it has a freshness and originality that sustain interest. the writing while occasionally a bit awkward is consistently interesting honest and moving. the themes of introspection nostalgia regret and defiance are presented in a searingly personal manner. the song if i were a man is a rich celeration of the wonders women bring to relationships and the world; child of steel plucks the heartstrings with an achingly wistful delicacy; and take my body is a strong lament about the objectification of women. i especially love the pared-down guitar arrangements; the simplicity really works with ms. cash's strong vocals and makes me wish some of my other favorite vocalists would occasionally just get back to basic guitar accompaniments. i've seen ms. cash perform live and while she has other hits that may be more popular this collection reveals her unique brilliance ",positive
" first bill has never nor will he ever be a jazz musician. it seems that those who branch out and play multiple styles are often lauded for expanding the vocabulary. here's what chaps my hide the most. bill has somehow captured the attention of hordes of budding guitarist with their effect pedals all strung out as if they were getting ready for a space shuttle launch. it burns me too no end when a person calls himself a &quot;jazz&quot; guitarist but doesn't really have any chops. i know bill has been called anti-technique but what does that really mean? would you want a heart transplant performed by a surgeon that means well but really isn't very good at what he/she does? this guy is getting built up as something new and it seems every time i turn around someone that knows absolutely nothing about jazz guitar is throwing this guy in my face. i've been a professional jazz guitarist for 12 years and teaching for 8 years. when i have guys that actually debate me that bill is somehow doing more interesting things than say pat martino or that bill could somehow hang in a jam session with someone like pat martino i have to shake my head in disbelief in how twisted and mixed up this world has become when charlatans are giving more credit than someone like pat who has been on the road for years and paid dues that frisell couldn't imagine. is bill frisell a jazz musician no! maybe if the guy could woodshed for a dozen years he'd come up with something. for me i'll stick with the guys that really know how to play......johnny smith peter leitch jim hall pat martino kenny burrell billy bauer tal farlow lenny breau jimmy bruno jimmy raney wes montgomery and so on ",negative

" i hesitated for so long to get this. having followed moby's rise since circa 1994 it has been amazing to watch what an impact he has had on music and on various cultural media over the years. i like his early techno/rave stuff and have enjoyed the gift he has for using electronica to score some beautiful and haunting hymns. but i wondered: has moby gone soft? has he sold out? i was pleasantly surprised. look at the cover and add rain. that's the overall mood of this album. i find rain to be cleansing on many levels often building a mood of pensiveness reflection and a fragile peacefulness. there is a glorious melancholy in the music the lyrics and the singing on the album. take the chilled out moments from moby's other albums and build on it. that's what he's done here. almost every song has singing - primarily moby's longing almost cyring voice - and almost every song is for those rainy nights when the world doesn't make sense when longing for companionship and understanding burdens the heart yet with a subtle hope underneath it all. it's downtempo mellow moody and sometimes sad. but it is beautiful. don't expect old moby don't look for the commercial jingles of play. just put it on and listen ",positive

" the first four albums are so unbelievably great that for me it's almost impossible to say one is better that the others. taken together they are almost like one long album. the family that plays together shows the band turning a slightly more commercial corner without sacraficing any of their artistic integrity. their blending of styles is a bit mote intergrated than on the first. randy california's influence on the music was becoming stronger as well. one thing that differd spirit from most of their comtempories was the strength with whch they were able to convey their songs in concert. i saw the original version 11 times and they never failed to astound me. it's a shame that the only legitimate live recordings of the band are of the later ed cassidy/randy california version. not that the later versions of the band weren't great - they just weren't quite as good as the original band. if your'e just being introduced to spirit the family that plays together is a fine place to start ",positive

" first i'd like to say that i am so glad there are artists like amel around who aren't trying to fit in with today's commercial r&b scene. as a long time fan of r&b and soul music i can't help but feel sad and dissapointed at the direction the genre is taking especially in regards to female singers. she may be beautiful but she doesn't need to use her looks to overcompensate for any lack of vocal talent by flaunting herself. amel has a beautiful soul and you can hear that through her wonderful voice and lyrics. every song on this album has at some point or another touched me some songs straight away while others grew on me slowly. you know how sometimes when you're listening to music and a particular lyric or vocal piece makes you shiver? amel's got that down for me. i was firstly introduced to nusoul by teedra moses someone who i've admired for two years now and who to me seemed one of the few decent r&b singers left. through teedra i stumbled on amel's bravebird and became more and more curious as i listened to the album over and over. like with most nu/soul the love i have for each song grew slowly and songs i thought weren't for me suddenly became my favorites on the album. i love that about amel; she makes me suprise myself as i become emotionally involved with her music and voice over time until i'm enchanted. for real hit me instantly as a beautiful song. i never get tired of it's cute opening where amel's daughter babbles something in baby talk! i'd love to talk about each song individually but i'd probably just bore you. to me amel's music is a personal experience and most likely strikes people in different ways. i will mention however congo - one of the songs on there i was tempted to skip at first but has fast become something of an obsession which crops into my head throughout the days with it's monotonous jungle vibe. other personal favorites include we can be new say you want it all i got2... hell the whole album really. along with other outstanding artists of the nu-soul genre amel has succesfully metamorphosised my taste in back music. trust me you'll never go back to commercial r&b again ",positive

" first here are some general positives about jaci velasquez: - she is a very gifted singer. her vocal range is top-notch - definitely on par with mariah carey and christina aguilera. - she is beautiful. and unlike a previous reviewer i do not consider the recognition of this attribute to be a sign of shallowness but rather a display of appreciation for feminine beauty. i like beautiful singing voices. i like beautiful women. there's no difference. - she has great spiritual depth. her music reflects key spiritual themes such as love faith and joy. now here's a critique of the cd: i listened to all the music samples (as you can do as well) and only one song caught my attention - lay it down. the other tracks have too much of a hard rock sound and were too experimental for my taste. but the song lay it down was different. it sounded more acoustic more in the style of folk rock - a genre that reflects my personal preference in pop music. i found the sound clip of lay it down to be intriguing because it reminded me of a hit song in the 1970's - eric carmen's all by myself later covered by celine dion in 1996. all by myself is a ballad having a soft understated introductory verse with an explosive chorus. the sample clip of lay it down appears to be in the same mold. it has a soft understated introductory verse; however it seems to lack an explosive chorus. listen to the sample and hear it for yourself. the introductory verse is closing with the following lyrics: all of my hopes and my dreams and my best laid plans are slowly slipping through my folded hands so far so good. there's only a piano and a violin accompanying jaci's soft vocals. next the song appears to be moving from the verse to the chorus and you hear the following lyrics: so i'm gonna lay it down i'm gonna learn to trust you now now here's a problem. i am expecting to hear the beginning of an emotional outburst - an opportunity for a singer with the pipes of jaci velasquez to showcase her voice. but it is not forthcoming. why? this intrigued me and i wanted to hear the whole song but i did not want to purchase a cd for only one song. luckily i discovered that a compilation cd of jaci velasquez's best songs was released recently and it contained lay it down. great! i bought the cd - on my knees: the best of jaci velasquez. this is what i discovered after listening to lay it down. - the first time through the verse and the chorus the song is definitely understated. we simply have the accompaninment of a piano and a violin with jaci's soft vocals. - the second time through the verse and the chorus a drum beat is introduced and jaci begins to let some emotion out beginning in the middle of the verse and when the song moves into the chorus a complete emotional outburst occurs. but somewhat to my dismay this is not the same voice that i am expecting from jaci velasquez. her voice was more raspy and raw (actually it was sounding more like demi moore or tara reid not that that is necessarily bad). furthermore she appeared to be struggling. is this the same voice that was soaring effortlessly through the stratosphere on songs such as on my knees speak for me and adore? is jaci velasquez losing her voice? i don't know but i find it very difficult to imagine that a young woman in her mid-20's is losing her voice. she is entering her prime. barring a health issue this just doesn't happen. lay it down is actually a pretty good song. in fact i am almost of the opinion that it may be her best. i certainly find myself listening to this song more than any of her others. lay it down has the same message as the beatles' classic let it be. the words are different but both songs share the same sentiment. actually now that i think of it...they do share a couple of words in common...the words let it be. here are the closing lyrics: i'm gonna let it be i'm gonna let it go i'm gonna lay it down the essential lesson being conveyed is learning to let go and let god - a profound spiritual insight. something that each of us here is learning. this song is heartfelt and gut-wrenching. and though her voice is struggling through it the song nevertheless works out its magic. i gave this cd 2 stars because i think jaci velasquez is attempting to redefine her music style and has not succeeded. interestingly enough her best sound was her first cd - un lugar celestial (a heavenly place). bring back the spanish/flamenco guitar and develop a more acoustic sound. in my opinion the acoustic sound is more spiritual. keep the piano and electric bass guitar but dispense with the hard rock electric guitar and synthesized sound effects. develop a latin folk rock sound with an element of jazz. hire a good saxophonist or a trumpet player. emphasize ballads. that should do the trick ",negative
" despite all reviews posted here in this page are given 5-stars to this release i need to be honest and explain why i am giving just one poor star. no i am not crazy. let me explain my point-of-view and after that you can decide if this jh album really deserves more stars. just to start this album does not have a spinal-column that could guide the band(?) or the musicians thru a solid path. there are tracks played by a duo trio 4tt and sometimes a very loose quintet and each of these tracks have a different mood without any presence of a jazz soul or even a real smell of jazz. maybe the intention of recording these tunes was to make a homage/tribute to mr strayhorn or maybe a recognition for mr henderson value in the 20th century jazz history as one of the most important hard-boppers ever. but the result was very poor. if you really love joe henderson (as i appreciate) try any of his albums from the 60's (as a band-leader or as a sideman) mainly those from the blue note era. in time: i gave one star in memory of his brilliant carreer. this particular album deserve zero-star.

" rock n' roll history has many example of band/artists unlucky that didn't get the recognition they deserve. here's one. what is big star about? a rock n' roll slightly psychodelic most influenced by beatles and the byrds. the first record (#1 record - 1972) is the battle of two frontman putting one classic pop-rock tune after another. chilton gets the most rock stuff chris the ballads and also a contribution from hummel the hippy india song. best moments: in the streets thirteen india song when my baby's beside me my life is right. the second album - radio city - 1973. chris left the band claiming that chilton was getting too much control of everything. for this record hummel contributes more the band goes torward some stuff slightly different like the soul intended o my soul (maybe a reflection of the record label atmosphere. chilton here also takes full control of the musical direction the albm sounds not better or worse but less laboured sounding in some tracks more like a rehearsal with a great garage feeling. stevens goes great on drums specally on back of a car. best tracks: way out west life is white (although the harmonica annoys me a little) mod lang (very bowie mood) back of a car september gurls. at a glance big star reminds me backing home from schoolplaying my guitar calling my girlfriend on the phone and waiting for the weekend to go to the beach. a feeling of youthness that doesn't come back just like those special moments in a band's career that later they can't catch anymore no matter how hard they try. for big star no differ they would never do anything like these two records. and sadly after bell's death chances are zero to none. why didn't they succeeded. well ego stuff lack of stax knowledge to deal with rock n' roll bands and the dicotomy that was ruling the rock n' roll scene at the time: hard rock versus progressive rock. and what about big star? neither hard rock nor progressive. but despite all that rubish big star is pure rock n'roll guitar band 70's style recognizable in many current bands recording all over the world. big star is eternal.

" i was overall disappointed by this cd. there are many good reviews here but they generally overpraise. tracks 4 through 8 have too much synthesizer for my ears. a major highlight is track 9 the crab and the egret but interestingly the flute is accompaniment to the wondrous chinese percussion. disappointingly the cd is only 40 minutes long and left me wanting more tunes without synthesizer accompaniment ",negative
" almost 10 years later... and i am still waiting for the punchline. i think this is the most properly named album of all time... as the easiest summation is: it lacks any punch and keeps you waiting for something that never comes! its terrible especially when contrasted with pornograffitti. gone are the great guitar tone riffing rhythm power and groove that marked most of the prior three albums. it's what the forth side to iii sides to every story could have been... yours mine the truth and the suck. the songs are lackluster but its really the guitar sound that kills this album album. no respect surprisingly by name is the only song worth any respect and the only song near upbeat on the album. waiting for the punchline still remains in my top 5 worst albums of all time... i dont write negative reviews unless a cd is really bad in general or really bad compared to the bands other work. in this case it fits both... its bad for extreme... and stands up as exceptionally bad among all other bands' albums as well. conversely in my opinion iii sides and pornograffitti are 4 and 5 star albums respectively ",negative

" with all the recent praise heaped on smile orange crate art still remains largely under-recognized and under-appreciated. sure smile was supposed to be this grand copelandesque landscape of america from plymouth rock to the grand cooley dam. but for my money brian and van dyke parks did it so much better with orange crate art. having written what everyone unanimously agrees to be the most california of all anthems fun fun fun i get around and california girls brian turns his attention to a california not of hot rods and surf but of sun drenched valleys rich with citrus and vine. here wilson and parks celebrate and pay homage to the likes of jack london and john steinbeck. and if all this were not enough we're treated to my hobo heart a latter day van dyke parks / michael hazelwood masterpiece. there's also the lovely palm tree & moon a dreamy little ode to a moonlit beach territory not unfamiliar to brian. and summer in monteray is so unabashedly nostalgic it would even make clint eastwood blush. if you haven't become familiar with this so very underated collection yet you really can't call yourself a brian wilson / van dyke parks fan until you give this one a fair shot. you might even find yourself humming sail away or hold back time while in the shower. i know i did ",positive
" i first became a fan of the gorillaz with their excellent 2nd cd demon days. the interesting thing about this band is that their music is so strange and so out there that when you first hear one of their cd's...it sounds like complete garbage. but once you listen again and again you start to like it more and more. eventually you end up really liking the cd. that was the case with demon days. after enjoying that cd fully i thought i should check out the first gorillaz cd and i didn't like it all that much. there just seems to be very little actual songs on the cd. way too much of it sounds like complete filler. there were a couple throwaway songs on demon days but most of the stuff on that cd was great. here we've got songs that are just...boring. nothing happens. i was waiting for the melody or a cool tune to occur in some of these songs but it never happens. you just listen to 2-d whining into the microphone with dull beats in the background. (such as on songs like new genious man research and starshine.) some songs are nothing but beats with no lyrics at all sometimes sounding just like static noise. songs like this such as double bass are cool for a minute or two but the song drags on for practically 5 minutes. it gets boring. other songs like 5/4 m1 a1 and rock the house are catchy at first but just don't have staying power. they get old. 5/4 got annoying quickly m1 a1 and punk lost their appeal quickly and rock the house is another song that would have been better if they cut about 2 minutes out of it. and songs like latin simone are just annoying. the remixes of 19-2000 and clint eastwood that end the cd are also fairly forgettable although 19-2000's kind of catchy on the first couple listens. there are some good songs here though. tomorrow comes today clint eastwood gravity 19-2000 and left hand suzuki method are cool songs. slow country's kind of cool too. and dracula's got an awesome almost haunting sound to it and it's really absorbing. although it too unfortuantely loses its tune and turns to repetitive and aimless techno noise about half way through it. this small collection of good songs though is surrounded by a huge collection of filler tracks. much of this cd just isn't really that good. i don't know...this cd just seemed empty. very few meaningful tracks lots of filler and some really annoying and repetitive songs. some good songs were stretched to almost 5-minutes long mostly given filler techno beats that ruin the songs. clocking in at 72 minutes (which makes it 22 minutes(!)longer than demon days) this cd was loaded with filler and just not enough good stuff. people interested in the gorillaz should pick up their superior follow-up demon days instead of this one. if i listened to this debut cd first i probably wouldn't have ended up liking this band very much. the good news about this is that the gorillaz have not hit a sophmore slump; their cds are getting better not worse. that is a great sign for the future of this awesome band.

" when the airplane kept it tight as in 'white rabbit' 'somebody to love' they were a force to be reckoned with but when they got ideas above their station as in this live album there musical weakness really showed. now i happen to think that jack cassidy just about saves the band with that bass but even he can't stop the monotony of 'bear melt' and 'rock me baby' surely the worst version i've ever heard and this is all down to jorma kaukonen's nasal vocal and mediocre guitar soloing. the guy maybe a great acoustic picker but his lead work leaves a lot to be desired and this is from someone who had to endure his interminably uninspired lead work at a hot tuna gig. anyone who saw the clip in woodstock will know what i mean..no wonder hendrix's set was so eagerly awaited!occasionally the band get it together and balin and slick's vocals mesh together brilliant but on the whole the set is an endurance test and the studio versions are far more immediate. face it when it comes down to it very few west coast bands could stretch out and reach the heights of say cream or ten years after. as i said casady is per usual on form but the drumming is fairly pedestrian throughout lacking the kick that could push the jams into another gear. it's better than 'thirty seconds' but then again anything is. if you think that 'happy trails' and 'live dead' are musical highpoints than this will complete the set but i just think its sleep inducing ",negative

" first of all let me clearly state that im from atlanta and i am a diehard fan of lil scrappy and that is why it breaks my heart to tell you that this cd is garbage. besides money in the bank there are no other standout cuts and it is a shame because the underground mixtape he dropped with dj don cannon early last year was on fire he and cannon delivered all new tracks and there were all on point that was of course before 50's influence which brings us to our problem. the influence of curtis jackson a.k.a 50 cent is very clear on this album. i like 50 but he knows little of the way we make records down south. if the g-unit boss would have just stayed out he way and let scrappy pick and choose his own tracks verses etc. everything may have been fine. the guy is a control freak and as a result nobody in the a is pumping this and it is a shame because when scrappy is on point the boy is unstoppable. this cd is garbage plain and simple and 50's influence is going to put the the crown prince of the south's career in serious jerpody unless he quickly wise's up. this is an honest review from a fan that has been down since day one.i have bought all the mixtapes and everything else he's dropped but im telling you if you the consumer buy this cd you will regret it and to scrappy ditch the g unit do what's in your heart and get back to business.

" for those who were fortunate enough to aquire one of the first two releases of the thief soundtrack (like myself) congratulations - you have the version of the cd that contains the best song on the soundtrack beach scene. it has been dropped for this us release. for those who were interested in obtaining the thief soundtrack being mainly interested in the one song beach scene (most of the other songs can be found on other tangerine dream albums) please realise the following differences between beach theme and the now dropped beach scene. the song beach theme is a much shorter track (almost by half) and there is a very cheesy acoustic rock n' roll drum beat that was mixed/dubbed over the original beach scene song which has the much more mellow and less invasive electronic sequenced drum beat in it. it's beach scene that was both heard in the movie and over the airwaves back in 1981. if that is the song you remember (fell in love with) and are looking for do not buy this latest release. keep looking for those out of print cds - they are out there. on a lighter note it's very nice to see they added the ending/end-credits song confrontation. this is a lose/win scenario for thief soundtrack fans - it all depends on which song is more important to you. if you already have the earlier releases with beach scene on it then buying this latest version will now complete a defninitve soundtrack for them as that last song in the movie has now finally been added to the official soundtrack ",negative
" ...because it felt like it predicted that i'd be listening to the cd someday. i'm referring to the line the kids of ad 2000 will draw from the music much the same sense of well being and warmth that we do today. now i admit that i was 18 in 2000 so i guess i technically missed the literal kid description by a year but the more general prediction of the inter-generational timeless appeal of the beatles was right on. i didn't see them on the ed sullivan show. i was born almost twelve years after they broke up and about a year after the tragic shooting of john lennon. but i like many many other people born too late to have experienced beatlemania as it was occuring have since become a huge fan of all their work. this album has my favorite of all the beatle's songs: i'll follow the sun. that song alone is worth the five stars but thankfully the rest of the album is great too. this album gets a little bit too much grief and it may not be quite as amazing as something like abbey road but it's still better than just about anything else out there.

" following on from the fantastic 'the duel' allison moorer's latest release 'getting somewhere' is a massive massive disappointment. quite simply the material on 'getting somewhere' is weak and gutless. on the rare occasions moorer tries to emulate the beauty and feel of 'the duel' - such as on hallelujah & new years day - earle rips the heart out of the material with such an amateurish pedestrian and thin production that you feel cheated ! business and pleasure rarely mix and moorer should take a long hard look at this release and give serious consideration to re-installing rs field next time around. if moorer wants a guitar groove that burns drums that drive and vocals that mesmerise then earle is simply not the man for the job. moorer is a fantastic talent who has one of the finest female voices of any genre (she can write a mean song too ! ) . this cd showcases none of her abilities and should be consigned to the bargain bins immediately ",negative

" i'm not sure what took me so long to get it but i'm just coming across this album. it never made a blip on my radar i guess. anyway i saw it at a local record store in the used bin for $2.00 and it was hardly used -- even the jewel case was flawless (it looked like it was only played once and then taken back to the store). obviously the owner before me didn't know what they had on their hands and the store manager didn't know either due to it's low price tag. balance is a must have album without question. it came out in '03 i'm just getting it here in late '05 and it still sounds fresh. there are so many bangers on this album that listing them would make this a five paragraph review. of the 16 joints (including the bonus track) i'd have to say that 14 of them are amazing. akrobatik rhymes with an honesty and realism that is rarely heard in rap (even amongst underground emcees). the songs compliment and play off of each other without them all sounding the same. i did mention that there were two songs that i could've done without. those songs are hand that rocks the cradle and always bet on ak. they aren't bad but i find myself skipping them everytime i play this cd. balance is a must have lp. i still feel a bit cheated since i just found out about this album. there has to be some sort of promotion for this guy. i did get the black dialogue (perceptionists) album and i knew about the lost adats and the ep but somehow i completely missed this one. don't be like me if you haven't heard this yet grab it as soon as you can. you won't regret it. this is one of the best albums on 2003. highly reccomended. standout tracks: time woman ii remind my soul balance hypocrite limelight front days here & now wreck dem feat. mr. lif cooler heads feedback feat. diamond d and bone crushe ",positive

" those who liked suede may be looking for more of the same from the tears but despite the obviously recognisable vocals from brett and the familiar wailing of bernard's guitar this marks a watershed in their repertoire. the most obvious difference is that all the songs seem to have been crafted as 'hits' (much more radio-friendly and why not?). it's also a more mellow sound than suede (there were fewer opportunities for vigorous bouncing and hand-clapping at the tears concert i attended). another important difference is the guitar work with bernard soaring off into sonic highs not experienced since reeves gabrels and tin machine. among the better songs are apollo 13 brave new century refugees and co-star. though brett and bernard are capable of better this is a shot in the arm for us disenfranchised suede-heads and i recommend you turn it up loud ",positive
" a lot of people are saying that this album is better than their 1st one. that's not saying much because their 1st album was terrible. there was only one direction they could go -- up. it's hard to imagine them doing worse than their first lp. i said this about the young fly & flashy album and the same applies here so i'll say it again: when the hottest line on your entire album comes from bow wow your album is in serious trouble. but let me balance that statement though. this isn't exactly one of those album you buy when you want lyrical gymnastics. this is simple bass heavy crunk music. it's effective in it's purpose but it's totally generic (the recipe for most party songs). and some of these songs are just flat out horrible. stop callin' me isn't only horrible but it isn't about anything if you're paying attention to the wack lyrics dfb put on it (and whoever wrote the hook should be slapped). and who's idea was it to let dame dash (yeah that dame dash) scream all over a song (bricks 4 the high)? i want to know who the guy was that said yeah that's a good idea. dame is doing what he does best so he's not at fault.....i blame the idiot that put him on the song. suckas come and try me is probably the worst song to come out of the south since drama dropped his album. and if you ask me the white tee remix was a step backward from the original. it would help if they could talk about something other than haters postin' up on the block (i swear they say that on the album at least 100 times) rims jewelry and weed. but expecting them to change up their sound would be silly on my part i guess. besides if people buy this why should they change? that's another story though. in short the album fails to seperate dfb from the pack. the beats are generic and the rhymes are terrible (i'll make you 1 2 step like ciara? come on i could write that in my sleep) and it's hard to tell if there are four rappers or just one because they all sound similar. once you understand the purpose of this album though then you can find a few decent tracks but don't go getting your hopes up just yet. there are only 3 or 4 songs worth hearing. my music is listenable and dfbs put down some decent lyrics that are helped out by bun b's good appearance. the best beats on the album are on don't play with me feat. three six mafia and freaky as she wanna be. don't play with me features production from dj paul & juicy j so you know it's tight. i love three six so that's my favorite song on the album. and freaky as she wanna be will be the second single off the album if they're smart. on top of our game is good for what it's supposed to be good for (partying and....well that's it) but not much else. jermaine dupri is trying his best to keep his label relevant but i don't know if this approach is gonna help him any. this album is better than their debut but that's not really saying much. this should be pretty obvious but i'll say it anyway. if you're into lyrics then this isn't for you. if you want crunk beats to bounce to then this is right up your alley. it depends on your preference but this listener has heard better crunk music and recommends passing on this one. standout tracks: freaky as she wanna be i think they like me (remix) feat. jd da brat & bow wow don't play wit me feat. three six mafia (my favorite) and my music feat. bun b.

" as others have noted this was a time of turmoil for the group. now trimmed back to a fourpiece (they had just lost guitarist/singer bob weston and singer dave walker) they also changed producers after 5 straight albums they had either self-produced or collaborated with martin birch on. this cd also leans really heavily on material from bob welch (this would be his last release with the band) and it suffers deeply for that. most of the few highlights here are furnished by christine mcvie. the title cut is a nice lament about male prevarication. the understated prove your love is also a winner. of the welch contributions the only real standouts are the mystical bermuda triangle and gentle closer safe harbour. there are plenty of miscues filler and outright bad material here. mcvie's come a little bit closer is produced like it wants to be a hit but it's much too slight to stick in the memory. welch's she's changing me sounds like chicago colliding with the mac...the horns don't work here. the handclap bridge in silver heels seems too poppy and out of place in the context of the rest of the tune which is execrable anyway. the silver lining to this disc is that what might have been a death knell turned into the band's finest hour just one album later..

" this is a wonderful view into what is the best and worst about a tedeschi concert. she can be as soulful as the best of the blues singers but it also exposes her weakness: she just can't rock enough to provide the balance her act needs. she's terrific on the ballads but isn't a good enough guitar player to hold up the guitar playing for a band so they have to make do with her fabulous vocals. she's got solid keyboards and vocals in support so it's not apparent until half way through the gig. but keyboards can't provide enough of an edge to the very few fast upbeat songs and the whole concert lags. zzzzz by 2/3rds of the way through. look at the audience at the end of the concert when she plays a lethargic version of i fell in love. very few people (besides the b3 player who has kept the only energy up through the show) are energized. put this dvd on when you're in bed with a glass a red wine with your loved one and the fireplace is going and it'll be terrific at least until you fall asleep ",positive
" sam moore's new cd is a welcome return to the roots of soul. this cd has got it! sam's voice is superb and the duets he does with his guests are wonderful. i'm not a fan of country music so i was a bit fearful of what wynona and travis tritt would do with sam. wow! are they ever good! wynona's got it. i'm going to listen to more of her now. the musicians are the best! i thought i could hear that wonderful touch of earth wind and fire on some of the numbers so i went searching the notes. sure enough--there is reggie young--the wonderful earth wind and fire trombonist! go reggie! billy preston is wonderful on you are so beautiful as is the accompanying guitar by eric clapton. this is a musician's cd--quality all the way. i have had the great pleasure of seeing sam moore and billy preston in person (with bowzer's doo wop party--thank god for bowzer bringing back all these wonderful artists) and they were wonderful. i'd love to see even more of sam moore. thanks to randy jackson for putting this together. this is a class-act.

" there is a saying in the construction industry tripping over dollars to pick up nickels. or in the regular world can't see the black forest for the trees. i doubt if there is an definitive rendition of all of beethoven's symphonies. even the composers own conducted versions changed over time and from performance to performance depending on the players or his intentions. instruments were constantly changing and you know this guy was never satisfied always stretching. we can only guess what his exact intentions would be today or tomorrow. what you want to remember is: 1) the first version of anything you seriously like will color your listenings of subsequent versions. you'll be listening for qualities that aren't there and missing qualities that are there. 2) different versions bring us different views. isn't that a good thing? sound in all it's forms is preferable than a useless search for the best sound. i'd rather have that kind of an attitude than the bickering negative perfectionist snob attitudes of some of the reviewers here. having said that... i love these versions. i've had them for some time. i have at least 4 versions of the symphonies. these are clear well recorded dynamic and straight forward. beethoven's passion mental range and personal warmth are within. you can easily hear the information that beethoven wanted you to hear. probably better than he could. no make that clearly better than he could. ha ha! these are solid lovely beautiful and astounding. listen to them ",positive
" i consider this the first album in the second half of the career of oasis. following the departure of bonehead and guigsy this album is basically all the gallagher brothers. having learnt lessons from be here now oasis have gone back to a more basic style of production as opposed to the over the top production from be here now. while the songs are not as good on here they sound better and the whole album sounds as if it wasn't as rushed. this signifies a big change of direction for the band with little less ego's and a more sober approach to their music it is only the songwriting that lets this album down. my least favourite of all oasis albums it features two really good songs 6 mediocre and 2 dreadful ones. it is missing another two songs to make it complete i think it should have included the b'sides 'lets all make believe' and 'carry us all'. it still includes a few beatle-esque songs 'who feels love' and 'roll it over' and noel once again takes over lead vocal duties this time on two tracks 'where did it all go wrong' and 'sunday morning call'. this is a very important album it grounded the band again after their ego's had taken off. this helped relaunch the career and because of it they sound at their best today ",positive

" judas preist's 1974 debut album. this is simpley weird i could see why the band hates this album so much...simpley becuase it is so uneven and utterly sloppy and the production sounds like they recorded it in bfi dumpster. when i first got this i was like what the hell? granted debut albums are far from perfect but this was just downright miserable. this sounds like a combination of pink floydrushblack sabbath and cream on an acid trip. the song rocka rolla was ok and so was one for the road but the rest of the material was abismal. sad wings of destiny was such an improvment from this mess! the coolest thing about this album is the weird scrapping guitar effects tipton makes on one of the songs! i'm surprised that this was even issued on a cd the band doesn't even acknowlege the existance of this album and i can see why! fortuanatly they prooved to be so much more then what this platter of stange noises provided us with. i know that there are some that like this but not me! it is very blues based in some songs and the most annoying thing is that some of these numbers will put you to sleep. any one expecting a rocking metal album from the preist will be let down by this ",negative
" i'm really not sure what the purpose of this disc is other than as an adam ant filler for those collectors who need to add more to their collection. this is a slightly scaled down version of the truly best of antics in the forbidden zone which detailed adam ant's career up until the bombastic apollo 9 album. essential adds the 1990 single room at the top from manners & physique album and wonderful from the 1995 wonderful album. these two songs are not really worth the cost of admission and i think are probably the weakest songs on those two albums anyway. and of course essential ignores the unreleased 1993 album persuasion which had some really good songs on it. if you want later period adam ant manners is really good and wonderful is well less than wonderful but still a worthwhile adam ant. if you want an introduction to adam ant the chronologically catalogued antics is great and a more complete collection!

" released by atlantic five years after it appeared in australia presumably to meet high demand for ac/dc's music this international version of dirty deeds done dirt cheap is a farce. once again somebody had the rather strange ideas of altering the song sequence and replacing both r.i.p. (rock in peace) and jailbreak two of the strongest numbers in the album's aussie version with t.n.t.'s rocker and love at first feel an ok if not spectacular song. ah and problem child already featured in atlantic's version of let there be rock is also included in here. the same song in two different official albums. marvelous!. oh yeah and somebody hired hipgnosis in order to re-design the front and back covers. that was a cute detail but the aussie version's covers (classic mid 70's cartoonish artwork) are far more appealing. who's to blame for this rip off?. somebody at atlantic records?. some members of ac/dc?. maybe both?. who cares anyway?. once again now that i've got used to the aussie album listening back to this product feels worse than a hangover from consuming adulterated low quality spirits. every enthusiastic record collector knows that both warner music and sony music are serious labels that took and still take risks by signing up cutting edge artists and by respecting their will. so it seems that with their approval of this re-issue the surviving members of ac/dc are the ones to blame for this farce to go on and on and on ... if this is so ... well ... guys we the fans made you filthy rich. we deserve the real deal available worldwide at a reasonable price. i only give this product a 2 star rating just because love at first feel remains unreleased in australia. how unusual!. a final word about this re-issue: i don't own it. in the words of pete townshend i won't get fooled again. in order to get bonus material you must go through an irritatingly cumbersome internet gimmick. if bon scott (undisputedly the band's most uncompromising member ever) was still alive i believe things would be different. by the way if you are interested in the real stuff please be so kind as to read my review of dirty deeds done dirt cheap (import). other items to be avoided: the skimpy retrospective ep '74 jaibreak and bonfire a rather steep box set in which at least 6 songs are repeated twice in different versions. none of these titles include all the songs left out by the adulteration of ac/dc's first four aussie albums ",negative

" this album is by far on the greatest recent live recordings. sheryl crow demonstrates her influence and talent by putting on an all star show with some of the biggest names in music history. sheryl shines on her own singing some of her great hits but it's the duets that really make the album. my least favorite has to be the dixie chicks just because i can't appreciate the country flare they bring to strong enough but it's still a great version. chrissie hynde one of the album's highlights brings intense attitude to if it makes you happy still one of my favorite sheryl songs. stevie nicks remains stevie nicks giving more than enough emotion and flare to her own gold dust woman. sarah mclachlan's usually soft voice comes out strong on the difficult kind and compliments sheryl's quite nicely. my favorite rendition has to be eric clapton and sheryl together on cream's white room the rock-out moment on the album. the show is complete when all the guests return to belt out bob dylan's tombstone blues and close the show with a definite bang ",positive

" one reviewer remarked that morten veland had &quot;done it again.&quot; yup he shot himself in the foot again just like he did on tristania's &quot;beyond the veil.&quot; veland has an obvious talent in songwriting and building arrangements and he definitely has a knack for surrounding himself with quality musicians. his problem is that rather than using his death metal growling for proper effect where it's appropriate he just plasters it everywhere and again lessens what would otherwise have been an incredible cd. with all of the talent that is present in this band it would certainly have been better to let them come out of the background a little more. the songs where veland does that (which are all too few) like &quot;on the wane&quot; are easily the cd's best moments. to the band's credit the songs are more varied than on botv with some of the guitar parts sounding like more traditional heavy metal riffs (especially at the beginning of the opening track). it's definitely still melodic goth-metal but shows some new directions for veland which i find promising. now if he would just cut back on the growling...say to 50% of the cd...sirenia's next cd will be a sure winner ",positive

" this cd offers a great deal of incredible music by john lennon during 1969 and the early 1970's when he fought our government in order for him and yoko to live in the united states. the quality of the music is excellent and after you listen to this cd you want to run to watch the film! the cd starts off strong with power to the people. the song makes its political statement and offers a great beat that sticks in your mind. it is also very upbeat and aggressive in its tone which attracts the listener immediately to make them want more. the listener won't be disappointed. the tracks that follow provide great insight into john's politics at the same time that he provides us with his singularly beautiful music. great songs on this cd include the autobiographical nobody told me in which john admits that his struggle with our government both to end the vietnam war and to remain in the usa is harder than he thought it would be. working class hero has a folksy bluesy feel to it but then the cd goes right back to that unique john lennon rock and roll flavor with the song i found out. bed peace follows as a type of introduction to the only beatles song on this cd the ballad of john & yoko. despite the catchy rock and roll beat to the ballad of john & yoko the lyrics tell the sad story of how people harass john and yoko. another great song is give peace a chance; the message here is obvious. love imagine and oh my love are beautiful ballads with excellent musical arrangements; and we get a new instrumental version of how do you sleep that is very well done. in addition i like the two live tracks from the john sinclair freedom rally in 1971. attica state is a brand new release and john sinclair packs a strong punch! these tracks demonstrate so well john's ability to connect with his audience in a live setting. one special song on this cd directly challenges each and every listener to personal reflection and insight: happy xmas (war is over). john and yoko tell people to know the difference between the blessings of peace and the evils of war to cherish what is morally right and to fight against anything that is morally wrong. the song also expresses hope for a peaceful future beyond the current christmas season. happy xmas (war is over) continues to play on radio stations every christmas season to this day. yes another amazon reviewer correctly notes that yoko talks a little bit over the very beginning of the song oh my love. thank goodness that she doesn't talk over the lyrics! a few brief dialogue excerpts from the film are peppered throughout the cd but they never overlap with the songs. the cd ends with the same strength that it started with: instant karma! (we all shine on) is an excellent song that most lennon fans will always love. the liner notes include some great black and white pictures of john and yoko including two from the infamous bed-in. you get the song credits along with the year that each song was released and there is a brief essay by yoko ono herself. overall this cd is more than just a retrospective of john's music during a turbulent period in his life. oh sure almost all of this music has been previously released. however that's not relevant here. the cd celebrates lennon's ability to communicate his political beliefs through his songs. these songs remind us to avoid genocide to be true to oneself and to strive for peace--now. i highly recommend this cd for lennon fans fans of great 1970s rock music and anyone who wants to experience how john lennon taught us what was right through his music.

" joe bonamassa is a blue/rock musical phenomenon that is awe-inspiring to anyone who will take the time to listen to his music. in his musical style/class i would count him the second greatest musician on the planet - with walter trout weighing in first place. as you can easily see from all of the other reviews i believe that you will find this cd well worth purchasing - as i have found all his material is. (after purchasing this item i eventually went on to purchase everything he produced and haven't been disappointed.) as with any cd you may not like all the selections but i believe the vast majority of his material you will. among my favorites on this cd are: `pack it up' `you upset me baby' and `man of many words'. bonamassa is an extraordinary adept and versatile musician. since he is young and gifted we can expect many more superb cd's in the future. highly recommended ",positive
" hard smart creative funk can be a hard pursuit in life these days. even with the age of the reissue firmly upon us finding a decently accessible funk album can be a real biyatch. thankfully secrets under the usually readily available columbia jazz header is probably just sitting there in your jazz section pleading with you to pick it up for $9.99. should this be a hard decision? emphatically: no. although i can see where previous reviewers are coming from trying to compare this outing to headhunters is truly unnecessary. with this '76 effort herbs is definitely toeing the fine line between jazz funk and disco but it all works. doin it is a super super heavy funk jam and sounds like it was culled from the man-child sessions. and although gentle thoughts can be interpreted as a dated sound it probably stands as my favorite rip on the album. it's got a great walking bassline and super funky breakdown and as always herbie dancing on the keys. go get secrets don't think about it. it'll always be an easy go-to funk bomb just when you need a little infusion ",positive
" the music of dowland is wonderful - but sting isn't up to interpreting it. you can't even distinguish the words half the time just a jumble of nice sounds from his pretty tenor - he doesn't possess the skills to carry it off. this music has to be interpreted by someone with an ability to express thoughts in heightened language...sting for all his merits hasn't got that in his repertoire yet. it's an exercise in pretention laughable at times. the letter reading is ridiculous. i love both sting's voice and dowland's song but this cd is a failure.

" let me the say that the vocals on this cd may be painful at first yet you get over them very quickly except for a few spots. even so they do not lower my score for the album and at times are quite catchy. savage - good riffs good solos catchy purely driven madness to start this insane album. 93/100 where my fortune lies - the intro is absolutely nuts and the highlight of the song. probably my least favorite after this yet the solos are still out of this world. 87/100 ninja - what a great song! the intro is one of the greatest things i have heard in my life and this song may actually have you humming along at points. ninja! very well laid out and the solos at the end are the best so far on the album. brilliance. 97/100 concerto - amazing once again and becker the 17 year old prodigy showcases himself throughout. he proves he is the master of sweeping and arpreggios all over this album and this song is an insane instrumental that captures melodies like none other. more notes played in 4 1/2 minutes than in george harrison's entire career. 98/100 burn the ground - fastest on the album solo wise in fact becker is so fast it is hard to believe that its human. very melodic too except when there are vocals the song is kinda of disgusting. 87/100 desert island -another amazing song very well laid out with great solos and great riffs. the outro is the perfect intro to speed metal symphony. the vocals are actually good on this song like ninja. an entertaining song. 97/100 speed metal symphony - nine minutes of shredding and arpreggios and all kinds of melodic madness that is beauty to any shredder's ears. everything about this song is good. 97/100 there isn't much to say about this album except becker and friedman show they are true masters of their instruments and are able to play in a melodic and listenable way. i would recommend this over yngwie malmsteen who has not improved since his first album ",positive
" i bought a copy for a friend recently and she said his music sounds so fresh and it's so singable. the lyrics are meaty too not just fluffy pop. i'm kind of obsessing over this music right now--which is fun! thanks so much... i'd like to see him in concert sometime. i had this album for a year before i really got into it since it takes a couple of listens to really appreciate. at first listen i really liked we'll do it all again and put it onto my mp3. a year later i finally got the album out again and it bleu me away. i realize that there is something slightly barry mannilowish about we'll do it all again because he has some lungs not because of style or anything. he reminds me more of jellyfish or they might be giants. some songs are so pathetic vulnerable and a little too honest for comfort as far as lyrics go but they are energetic and hopeful in their delivery. anyone who appreciates art for arts sake will probably like this album. the songwriting is superb and precisely produced. the second hidden track is a real gem that you don't need to relate to in order to appreciate. the lyrics are clever and fun even though several songs have a theme of loneliness.

" i bought this cd after hearing tony on one of the am morning shows and really likings some of his past offerings but i have to say that this cd was the pits and a waste of my money. i was ticked off to have bought this cd from a talented brother and not have gotten my money's worth. tony has been on the scene for quite a number of years and i expected a more mature offering from him than this latest. there is a great lack of maturity on this cd and it's an overall disappointment. unfortunately i have to say here that toney is not alone. what on earth possessed veteran soul singers the o'jays to sing a song like let's ride? who are they singing about girls their granddaughters ages? hoochie mommas? what? babyface? even he gets in on the foolishness of trying to sing like the hip hop crowd! and what's up with the explicit lyrics? we all know you can curse like sailors but why is this language necessary in music? and i know that artist have always performed their music but will someone tell me why it's necessary to perform with so few clothes on? i would rather hear your music not see your booty! sorry but a review i just read triggered me and i'd been thinking about the tony terry cd for a while. hope he comes up with a more mature offering the next time. meanwhile i think you're safe in skipping this particular cd ",negative

" in many ways a relic of its era not of this earth is the first widely distributed release by joe satriani (a previous ep ended up being reissued as part of time machine years later). the guitarist supported by drummer jeff campitelli and percussionist john cuniberti came into public attention when steve vai a former student of satriani ended up singing his teacher's praises in the music press. the result is that this album more than likely to have been lost in the shuffle of instrumental rock music received wider recognition and poised satriani to explode into a bonafide celebrity on his next record. the album itself is a bit uneven-- satriani is a flawlessly brilliant guitarist but as a songwriter he wasn't quite ready. several pieces (not of this earth hordes of locusts) seem to run out of steam before they end and a couple (the snake driving at night) feel like bad '80s metal. on the other hand several pieces shine-- delicate and lovely rubina reggaeish and emotionally soaked memories and the overtly frippesque new day are all fine examples of what satriani is capable of. but my favorite is probably brother john where satriani abandons all his effects and performs his delicate and bubbly melody cleantone. in the end the album is ok but satriani would go on to do so much more interesting in the future. come back to this one if you've picked up a bunch of other stuff and are looking for more but most should start with surfing with the alien ",negative

" this is not necessarily an indictment of aimee mann or holiday music....though i do find such disks as being cheesey. i was a bit surprised when i heard mann was coming out w/a holiday album. it seemed a bit above someone who has based a career on not only original material but non-mainstream music. it has also always surprised me that at the plethora of holiday disks that are out there and how many more come out each year. is it just me - or are there only 18 holiday songs in existance to begin with? there is only so many different ways to cover i'll be home for christmas winter wonderland - all of which i believe are covered by james taylor sarah mclachlan and better midler all of which were released this month. i'm guessing they are cheap to produce and easy to pull in profits. that being said - i still like mann's voice and she comes through with 3-4 songs that are above the fray. whatever happened to christmas christmastime and her original calling on mary. i also liked the fact that she covered you're a mean one mr. grinch. that seems to suit her more. not my cup of tea - but the songs i mentioned are the reason the disk gets 2 stars ",negative

" i consider this to be one of the finest live coltrane recordings out there. it was also one of the first coltrane albums i picked up and it was a fantastic gateway to some of his more abstract live recordings on followup releases like live at the village vanguard again and live in japan. this is much more similar to afro blue impressions which is another overlooked release. by this point in time trane had already done some work with eric dolphy and his playing was growing in a much more abstract direction as we would hear on a love supreme just one year later. one of the reasons why this disc is overlooked is because elvin jones is replaced by roy haynes while jones was serving some jail time. the absence of jones is noticeable but i still think this is worthy of five stars. the first 3 tracks are from the newport jazz festival and in addition to haynes and trane we have the remaining quartet members mccoy tyner (piano) and jimmy garrison (bass). tyner is especially amazing on 'my favorite things' which i consider the best version of that piece in trane's entire catalogue. i consider it to be a bridge to some of his later recordings. this is because we get trane's two sides. first of all there is great tone and lyricism in the first part of the piece. however the song still goes on for 17 minutes and the interplay between tyner and haynes for much of it is amazing. rounding out the performance is billy eckstine's 'i want to talk about you' with a mesmerizing credenza which is a staple of trane's technique followed by a 15 minute version of 'impressions.' again we hear trane's two sides. on one hand we hear where he is coming from. which is the confines of other jazz gods like miles davis and thelonius monk. on the the other hand we can see where he is going which is a much more abstract/free-jazz approach. once you can begin to understand trane's more abstract side you will find later recordings less challenging such as interstellar space meditations or a love supreme. in addition to the three newport recordings there is an extra track from november of 1961 from the village vanguard. 'chasin' another trane' is played by haynes and trane as well as dolphy on alto sax and reggie workman on bass. the presence of dolphy and the removal of piano makes this the most avant-garde piece on the record almost reminiscent of early ornette coleman. coltrane really cooks on this record and the sound quality is also pretty decent. it's not as crystal clear as his carnegie hall concert with monk but nevertheless i consider it a great place to start for trane fans who are reluctant to embrace his later music.

" this is a wonderful vangelis album and is fairly energetic with enough experimental flourishes to keep the listener fully engaged. released in 1975 heaven and hell incorporates a full choir into the vangelis sound. vangelis played all of the instruments on this album including synthesizers electric piano acoustic piano a full drum kit and percussion. vangelis is joined by the english chamber choir (conducted by guy protheroe) with vana veroutis as the lead female vocal in addition to jon anderson (vocals/lyrics on heaven and hell (part 1 so long ago so clear). vangelis is quite a good musician and really shines on the acoustic piano. as a huge yes fan i was delighted to hear jon's excellent voice and cosmic lyrics. as far as the inclusion of the choir goes i did not mind it that much and felt that it added a very interesting textural element to the recording. the heaven and hell suite is divided into two lengthy movements including part i (21'58) and part ii (21'16). in general the first part is more orchestral in nature and features the choir and excellent acoustic piano playing by vangelis. another general observation is that the first movement mixes vigorous sections that feature drums with spacey and haunting synth-dominated passages. of course my favorite part comes at the end of part i which is the 4'58 section with jon on vocals. this short song is quite moving and uplifting. movement ii is a little darker and more experimental than the first movement and is my favorite of the two. the choir is featured on the second movement along with a beautiful wordless vocal by the very talented vana veroutis. part ii closes with a very spacey and quiet synthesizer section which provides excellent contrast with the preceding thunderous percussion section. all in all this is a good vangelis album and is recommended along with albedo 0.39 (1976); spiral (1977); and the excellent opera sauvage (1979) ",positive

" this is i believe the best fleetwood mac album ever record by the band. it begins with a nice quick paced tune second hand news and proceeds to move into many textured songs from there. the album itself does not have a bad tune on it. in fact of all the 'regular' albums from fleetwood mac (excluding greatest hits compilations) this album has more hits on it than any other. hits like 'dreams' 'never going back' 'don't stop' 'go your own way' 'the chain' and 'you make loving fun. all of these get enormous radio play. moreover 'dreams' was a number one hit and the album itself held the number one slot for months on end and has sold over 18 million copies in the u.s. and over 30 million worldwide putting into the top 50 best selling albums of all time. in fact an interesting tid bit from the liner notes of the cd describe how the album had such an impact on america's youth that during that generation if you were to ask a student to spell 'rumor' there would inevitably be two 'u's' in the spelling. now that is a very strong impact on culture. every song on this album is arranged on the album as if it flowed right into the other making for an overall well rounded album. one of my all time favorite songs from fleetwood mac is on this album never going back which contains some great acoustic guitar work from one of rock's premier guitarists lindsey buckingham and in my opinion the best christine mcvie song ever written songbird. now with this release you can also get on a second cd the various rough takes and outtakes of the songs on this album. this makes for great listening to hear how the songs developed and were recorded. moreover early demos are included along with two 'jam sessions. now more than ever this is a must have cd for any lover of rock music (or music in general for that matter). if you are a fleetwood mac fan then chances are you own this album but if you are just getting introduced to the band then you must buy this cd. i highly recommend it ",positive

" back in the 70's and 80's i listened to a really great radio station wsgs in hazard kentucky. from my home in flat gap virginia and anywhere in the region it was well known that if you wanted real country music you simply had to turn on wsgs. 100000 watts of pure monophonic country music. i'm not talking about the big hats of nashville or the gussied up ladies who pose as country singers these days. no it was the real thing including local and regional bluegrass gospel hiccup preachers loretta lynn lefty frizzel merle haggard bill monroe grandpa jones and countless others. when i listen to this pattly loveless release i think she must have been listening too. it sounds just like the typical afternoon group of selections on old wsgs. only better because patty is from our time and seems to have that old time mountain shout-it-out style much like many of those who came before. she reminds me a bit of wilma lee cooper. what a voice! if you have never heard of these early country artists and you like the way patty does it up here it would be good to go back and see where she learned all this great music from. this is the real thing ",positive

" nana has a beautiful voice but her singing is monotonous predictable. she lacks passion. sometimes you feel she is reading the lyrics instead of really interpreting the song. in addition to this the arrangements are unfortunately very poor. her soprano range deserves a proper orchestra. only love could be the perfect background music for a romantic dinner with candles but this is not the album i would like to listen to again and again ",negative
" this talented woman can sing anything. i really enjoyed this cd with the lights turned down and a glass of wine to relax after a very stressful day at work. renee could definitely have another singing career outside of opera should she choose. hearing her drop that gorgeous voice down one octave rivals the best chanteuses in the business - cassandra wilson nancy wilson regina belle sarah vaughan etc. this cd of different musical styles reminds me of nina simone and cassandra wilson two great singers whom could interpret any song genre and make their versions special. i loved all the songs and the standouts here are haunted heart river my one and only love my cherie amour cancao do amor and beatles in my life and hard times come again no more. i hope renee keeps recording whatever catches her fancy because i'll certainly always listen ",positive

" people what a killer release this is. i bought it in '92 when it was released not knowing what to expect as i had never heard a single cut from it. i knew schonn was the axeman on this baby and that was all i needed to know. i popped this cd in the player and was instantly floored. what great melodic poweful tunes filled my ears. i'm not much of a ballad fan but even those are great. dean castronova on drums was the perfect choice for this type of release as he adds the power to schonn's precision. this is how neal would have played with journey had the suits let him do so. the gioeli brothers unknown to me at the time do a masterful job as well. it's such a shame that great bands make an album or two and just fade away ie. lynch mob badlands and these guys to name a few. this release is far superior to their second offering but that one is pretty tasty as well. i suggest paying the coin for this cd as it's worth every penny. hardline 2 will run you about twice as much but imports often do. get 'em both if ya' can but this one is the best of the 2. peace.

" i felt like i was taking a piss on myself the whole time i listened to this album. what happened to the 40 water of the old days that used to rap with spice 1 2pac and mc breed? this clone of 40 raps with the likes of lil jon (wack as hell) washed up 80 year old too short and a bunch of losers i have never heard of. the album only gets props because eightball and mjg are on the album and ugk. and they almost played themselves by appearing on this god awful so called album. e-40 has fallen into this commercial west coast version of crunk called hyphy in attempts to breathe life into his lifeless career. the album has some decent beats on it but there is no kind of lyrical content to be found anywhere. e-40 wouldn't know lyrical content if i slapped him with a krs-one cd. this cd is wack simple and plain pee-40 is a beat waster and he needs to find the nearest car wash and start drying off cars!!

" many musicians release some sort of experimental album at some point in their career. for peter gabriel every album is an experiment. usually musicians experiment by deviating from the norm; however on gabriel's fifth experiment so the ex-genesis frontman does the exact opposite. gabriel beloved for always doing something different decided on this album to play it safe - and for gabriel that is an experiment. previously he was a sort of cult performer but on so gabriel finally made it into the spotlight. big time. so was an immense success peaking at number one on the billboard top 100 receiving overwhelmingly-positive reviews (in 2003 so placed 187th on rolling stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time) and resulting in a sold-out tour. which brings us to one nagging term: sellout. though most who loved peter gabriel's first four albums loved so as well there are still many who call so gabriel's sellout album. to me that's just foolishness. peter gabriel has never sold out and i have no doubt that he never will. it's clear that on so he was trying to go in a more mainstream direction but that's probably the biggest experiment gabriel has ever undertaken save for his subsequent release passion. one popular theory amongst gabriel fans is that the album's title so is in fact an acronym for sell out (hence the uppercase capital s and the lowercase italicized o). i wouldn't be surprised at all if it was. so does sound very different from gabriel's earlier albums (though then again none of those sounded alike either). if anything it resembles gabriel's third self-titled release nicknamed melt. the thing that really separates those two - other than an obviously more commercial sound on so - is a feeling of warmth on that album unlike the harsh gritty darkness of melt. perhaps that's why listeners found so so charming. what does so have to offer? well a lot. for one thing there's the atmospheric opening red rain one of gabriel's finest tracks. like many of the tracks on the album it's dominated by ethereal guitar from david rhodes and heavenly synthesizers courtesy of gabriel himself. then there's one of the biggest hits of 1980s (which also spawned what may be the best music video in history) sledgehammer inspired by the motown music gabriel listened to as a child. with its pounding industrial percussion playful bass (by gabriel's exclusive bass man tony levin) and clever sexually suggestive lyrics it's no surprise that sledgehammer was a hit. after letting his silly side out gabriel tries to inspire with don't give up a nice song made great by heavenly vocals from another popular 80s musician kate bush. the subsequent track that voice again is my personal favorite song from this album. it features some excellent drumming from manu katche an immensely-talented drummer who has also played with artists like sting along with misty guitars delightful synthesizers and fine lyrics hit home by gabriel's pained singing. like the best tracks on so that voice again manages to be fun moody uplifting powerful warm and inspirational all at once. gabriel winds down a little for the dreamy powerful mercy street a song inspired by and written about anne sexton an american mental patient who relieved her depression through writing. as on his previous albums gabriel proves that he knows when to lighten up by whipping out big time a silly but fun track which also spawned an innovative music video. big time features heavy drumming from stewart copeland the former drummer of the police as well as some awesome cmi by simon clark. we do what we're told (miligram's 37) is about the experiments of yale professor stanley milgram. milgram would have his subjects administer shocks to actors who would scream in pain as the shocks became more and more horrible. milgram observed that his subjects would do what he told them to do despite the immense pain they appeared to be inflicting on the actors. he follows that rather cold song with this is the picture (excellent birds) a tensely surreal tune. the album closes with one of gabriel's most famous songs in your eyes. most people are familiar with the song from its usage in cameron crowe's romantic comedy masterpiece ... say anything where the song was used in what has become one of the most famous scenes in movie history. it's one of gabriel's warmest and most romantic compositions and also one of his best. on the original lp version of so we do what we're told closed out the album. that's a fine way to end it but it's also a rather cold way to end such a warm album. when the album was re-released remastered on cd in 2002 gabriel placed in your eyes at the end of the album as he originally intended. now that is the way to end it! so - how does so rank among the many other brilliant works of peter gabriel? well it ranks quite highly actually. it's one of the pinnacles of gabriel's career though whether it truly is the peak or not is hard to say. after all how can one compare gabriel's albums when they are all so vastly different? certainly though so is one of the finest gabriel masterpieces. this is fun well-crafted emotional music. so is so wonderful.

" i bought guerolito after hearing heaven hammer the remixed version of guero's missing. that remix by air is the sort of product that makes remixes valid - it takes the passion and yearning lost in the original production of missing and makes it feel at home in a louder more tempting sonic landscape. that song became astonishing where the guero song was simply alright and the new song clap hands is at least a good time. however it's hard to swallow the cobbled remixes on the rest of guerolito - the beat and the original of say earthquake weather (here as terromoto tempo) are both individually appealing enough but together sound dismayingly like they're from different planets and belong nowhere near each other. e-pro becomes a groaning mess the lovely farewell ride an electronic nightmare and both those descrptions would be apt to describe the record as a whole ",negative

" right so by putting a review down for this album i am getting labeled as an emo kid who wears his sweater too tight cuts himself and cries over his girlfriend all day long well too bad that's not me i am just a normal person who can tell the diference between bad and good music. hawthorne heights is an emo band who are criticised by lots and loved by lots of others i have to agree that their lyrics are quite simplistic and are used over and over they might even sound gay at some points although we are so last year made me laugh i should have known you better i should blame it on the weather wtf is that??? anywyas so the lyrics are probably the reason why i'm giving this 4 and not 5. but here we're talking music not lyrics. the music has nothing very special to it and i can play every song on guitar they often use the same chords except for a few songs this is who we are but they have a lot of interesting melodies and don't just rely on power chords to make their music interesting. even though these chord sequences are often re-used hawthorne heights always manage to make their sound diverse and interesting and they are slowly imposing themsleves as the kings of knock-out choruses. the other thing i have noticed in this album is that there are much less screaming parts which is an improvement and the guitarist has finally learnt where his place is in the band (behind his guitar) but also when is a good time to scream and when it isn't. this makes them quite different from most other emo bands who literaly destroy their sound with high shrieks. hawthorne have become a little darker and even tune down their guitars in some of their songs now adding a bit more heavyness. also check out where can i stab myslef in the ears to see how hawthorne have improved. overall this is a step forward from their last album it won't change the emo scene forever but it will leave its mark in your memories and will give you a good moment when listening to it ",positive
" while filled with talented performers this cd sucks. rocky is a campy 1970's b-movie that's what makes it enjoyable. even as a stage show it's a hokey rock-and-roll extravaganza. this cd tries to turn rocky into thoroughly modern millie and it just doesn't work. the corny sci-fi sound and less than amazing vocals are just what make rocky..rocky. this cast has so much less enthusiasm and energy than the original roxy cast. and lastly tim curry is frank. his rendition is too ingrained in my head for me to accept the twangy annoyance that is the frank on this album. ripley is a little too legit for janet and the female eddie weirds me out. buy the roxy cast. it's so superior it's almost laughable.

" i discovered seal the same way that most people did: through his utterly beautiful song kiss from a rose. i heard it on the radio one day and played it constantly for months after that until i finally decided to purchase the album the song was from. as it happens the song is from seal's most revered album his multi-platinum 1994 self-titled album. (this is not to be confused with his other self-titled album his debut released in 1991.) i didn't know what to expect when i bought the album having heard only one song from it but months after purchasing it i'm glad i made the gamble. i think that the sub-genre which best classifies seal is urban. urban music according to all music guide is smooth and polished often romantic sometimes uptempo and funky and features soulful vocals. seal has all of this and more. it has techno beats but they're not as overwhelming as one might expect. they blend together with peaceful occasionally ethereal guitars and seal's incredibly soothing singing. this is no doubt stylish music but first and foremost it's a collection of warm encouraging songs penned by a very talented musician. there's nothing that comes close to being a bad song here; there's not even a slightly weak composition. thus it's a little harder to pick highlights than usual. some highlights include the strong opening track bring it on; the emotional hit prayer for the dying; the shimmering dreaming in metaphors; the upbeat newborn friend; and needless to say the absolutely wonderful kiss from a rose. the closing track bring it on (reprise) is another beautiful song but kiss from a rose is possibly the most lovely song i've ever heard. listening to it in the warmth of one's home during a snowy december afternoon is an incredibly powerful experience. the message of the album if there is one is keep on going - life is beautiful! it could fail under any other popular artist but seal succeeds marvelously. this is some of the most heartfelt inspirational singing i've ever heard. there's a delightful optimism in seal's singing that sounds strong rather than naiive. it's hard to feel down after listening to such an uplifting album as this. seal is certainly one of the most talented musicians of r&b (or rock - you decide). these songs have clear strong messages warm inspirational lyrics heartfelt soothing singing danceable beats and a whole lot of emotion. once you've heard kiss from a rose i guarantee you'll want to pick up the album. if you're already thinking of doing so then i encourage you to go forward and buy it; you won't regret it. it's become one of my favorite albums. when you're feeling disillusioned or depressed with the state of your life or just life in general look no further than seal to make you cherish it once again.

" i picked this up in a bootleg store in korea a few years back since it was cheap and i had loved the movie (perhaps more so than any other of mallicks's others even - speaking of which if you get a chance to see badlands on the big screen do yourself a huge favour and do so). as i recall i didn't really enjoy it on first listen. but then somehow i got sucked in. almost as much as the film itself this is a hypnotic haunting slice of poetry. nothing happens for about a minute and then it builds and builds. unforgettable otherwordly and quite beguiling. the structure of the soundtrack (especially the songs toward the end featuring polynesian gospel-style singing) is strongly reminiscent of the mike oldfield cd 'songs of distant earth'. highly recommended but do give it a couple of listens because it might take a while to make its charms felt ",positive

" i have to admit that at first listening i found some aspects of ms.belle's interpretations of these pieces disorienting. however as i listened to these covers repeatedly i can now say that i understand better what the vocalist is after. not that i always agree with her and with george dukethe arranger/producer but i agree with their choices and their totally new project and enjoy having had my horizons broadened. ms.belle has immense talent superb technique and a clear idea of each piece and she delivers the goods without faltering or compromise. i admire that a lot in a performer. her choices ask us for a reaction and we are free to accept or reject what she has offered us. when i first heard these renditions i was quite stand-offish but over time i have come to appreciate them more and more - almost to the point of addiction - and am grateful to regina and george for their strength of conviction as well as their superior musicianship.they do not want us to listen in a passive way they are waiting for our reaction..and god this is really soso good....that's the true spirit in which an album should be recorded. i'd encourage you to get this album because it is about strong powerful and personal interpretations of some great jazz standards by regina. you may love everything about it or you may reject aspects of her interpretations. but in any case you will not remain indifferent; you will be enriched by hearing these pieces in a clear and beautifully personal way. that is an important aspect of why i love this imaginative innovative quality music and why this recording is invaluable. and it cannot be said enough that her backing band is incredible giving this album the necessary push to take it over the edge. it is a success because it skilfully avoids being categorized. regina has had the courage to break out of the traditional mould and make a successful cross-over which some purists may not approve of... only time will tell....

" if you're a strummer fan who is an historical completist then you'll want this disc. also there are some really good tunes on here for anyone particularly joe's keys to your heart. some of the live material here is high quality and some is not. this is likely not a cd you will listen to over and over again as you would artists who are fresh. but i'm just glad this finally appeared on disc as i've always wanted to hear it and as a joe fanatic i had to have it. there's moments here that sound like a rough draft of js and the mescaleros but also moments of pure rock 'n roll circa mid 70's with some great guitar solos. if joe had not been where uk punk started after this band there's no telling what he would have done but you can be sure he'd have kept playing in a band. i'm a huge clash and strummer fan but i rate this 4 stars more for its historical significance than for the actual quality and uniqueness of the content ",positive

" this cd has so much going on and going for it - it's one of the number one releases this year for jazz fans. lee ritenour is one of those guitarists who sculpted much of the west coast evolutions in jazz during the 80's and you can hear why people followed his flavor on these tracks. he's never sounded better and the musicians who contributed with him on this cd are tight and magnificent in their own right. blue in green is one of my favorite jazz compositions by miles davis and ernie watts on tenor sax more than does it justice. ocean ave. is as breezy and beachy as i think it's meant to be. my favorite tracks are easily she walks this earth (ivan lins' vocals are bossa nova beautiful) blue in green and predictably for me papa was a rolling stone with powerful crystal clear unique trumpet by chris botti and soulful rhythmic vocals by kenya hathaway and grady harrell. i went looking for that track because i am transfixed by chris botti's trumpet and what i found was a remarkable cd in its entirety. happy me. ; ",positive

" this collection of italian cello sonatas by the great janos starker is one of the most delightful chamber albums i own. the world renowned cellist was joined on this 1966 recording by pianist stephen swedish on five of the selections and by his frequent collaborator gyorgy sebok on the bach sonata in g minor which was recorded in 1963 and added to this collection to increase its length (it is a welcome addition musically too). the selections here range from famous composers like bach boccherini and vivaldi to the lesser known corelli locatelli and valentini. for me the common thread of this recording is the passionate performances of starker. whether it is the happy bounce of the vivaldi allegro the sublime rendering of the boccherini adagio or the precise interplay with sebok on the bach sonata starker plays masterfully and his cello is captured in rich full sound by the mercury living presence recording technique. this is an excellent purchase for all cello enthusiasts ",positive

" i didn't think it was possible for the delays to top their debut release - but they have. while faded seaside glamour is more immediately catchy and refined you see colours comes at you in a much more intense manner. the songs are more mature the musicianship is top-notch and the recording sparkles with fat bottom-end and soaring harmonies. the high points for me are valentine and winters memory of summer but there's honestly not a bad track on this release. the delays put it all together - great songwriting strong musicianship and excellent production in a genre-bending mix that has something for everybody. it's a shame these guys don't get more recognition here in the states. buy it ",positive
" van dyke parks did the arrangements on sam phillips's debut 'the indescribable wow' an album i love so much i thought i'd give 'song cycle' a shot. what a feeerocious disappointment! i'd give it zero stars if i could but amazon wouldn't let me! my god that singing voice of his reminds me of david bowie... the laughing gnome bowie that is... i've seen the word coy pop up in a lot of reviews to describe his singing er style but i'll go them all one better... smug. all i hear in it is ooh i'm so smart. what a clever lad am i. the arrangements or orchestrations or whatever you call them are all pointless. it gives me the feeling that van's dad bought him an orchestra and said here son have fun. so young van did... without ever really learning how to use it properly. randy newman knows how to use an orchestra; check out his best album 'sail away'. the arrangements are tasteful and key word here spare. he never clubs us over the head with them. the lyrics if we can call them such have no attachment whatsoever to the music.... but then again since i wrote that the arrangments are pointless i guess it's to be expected. so what we have is a trifecta of awfulness: bad voice bad lyrics and bad music. however he did make 'song cycle' in 1968 and worked on 'the indescribable wow' in 1988... so he did learn a thing or two in 20 years namely that arrangements are not songs; they're used to highlight a certain verse or chorus the singer really wants to put across to the listener... maybe randy pulled him aside once to tell him that...

" the living in oblivion series of cd compilations does something that many similar compilations do not do: they give us some great variety of hits. there is no doubt that mickey by toni basil was a huge hit. there's also no doubt that our lips are sealed was a break out hit for the go go's but the funboy three version wasn't. but what about living in a box? it only hit the billboard top 100 at #89 in 1987. so why is it here? why are a large number of these songs? they're not top 10 hits right? wrong! i'm sick to death of so many compilations relying on top 40 hits from the 80's. the u.s. music tastes are typically very different from those of europe. just because a song doesn't make the u.s. billboard top 40 doesn't mean that it isn't a hit in other countries. and although i'm an american my music tastes have always run more in line with those of europe. i'm delighted that the living in oblivion series (and the pop and wave series) have incorporated a variety of hits from the u.s. and europe. i also like that some of the more obscure groups and their songs are available on these compilations. there are several songs on these albums that never were released on cd (as they hadn't come into being at the time of the groups' albums initial releases) so albums such as these are the only place where you can find these hits. the boys don't cry song i wanna be a cowboy hit the billboard charts at #12 in 1986 but the group disappeared soon thereafter. then all of a sudden a dance version of that same song came out in the early 2000's and rocketed up the dance charts. don't be misled the living in oblivion series is one of the absolutely best series for a variety of music from the 80's. if you want to hear run of the mill top 40 only hits from the 80's well then you'll just have to look elsewhere. also the liner notes and pictures of the groups included in the jewel box are really clever. you get to find out what the chart position was for the songs in the compilation and see what the groups looked like at the time of the song's release. my only issue with these liner notes is that the author of them seems to be disparaging the very music which these albums are espousing. apparently many believe that the music from the 80's was vacuous and devoid of emotion. one need only listen to the song the promise by the group when in rome (living in oblivion volume 5) to know that such a statement is false. while that group only had this one hit and then faded into obscurity the promise made the billboard top 100 at #11 and the billboard dance chart at #1. anyway... i can't recommend this album and its entire series any more! it's simply awesome! before believing those who would disparage this series of albums please check the billboard charts and you'll see that these songs were in fact hits. get it ",positive

" and you will to. this music conveys the happy feeling of latin music produced for the american ear from 1946 to 1949. i picked up the album from amazon after listening to selected cuts offered by the yahoo music radio service -- el cumbanchero and cuban pete. the cuts are almost all strong and all are well recorded especially when you compare the sound quality to those on some other big band recordings that have been reissued. babalu which became desi arnez signature piece on the i love lucy tv show is probably one of the least appealing and that may be why it was used comedically in the tv show through the years. the highlight cuts include -- peanut vender holiday in havana you can in yucatan and brazil. while brass strings drums and guitars tend to dominate much of today's music this album gives the spotlight to a variety of percussion instruments flute clarinet and bass clarinet. it is refreshing to hear them in solo. the liner notes by will friedwald are extensive and give you a glimpse into this period of desi's life between his movie career and the defining work he and lucille ball did on television in the 50's. i could not recommend this album more and hope you enjoy it as much as i did ",positive

" as a kid out of the blue was one of the first albums (actually 8-track) i paid for. that decision was made after hearing sweet talking woman as a single and after i bought it the album grew and grew with me. every few weeks a different set of songs stuck with me as memorable. the first few weeks it was sweet talking woman turn to stone and mr. blue sky (all pop perfection); the next few weeks it was wild west hero across the border and jungle. after three months there wasn't a corner or edge of the album i didn't know and like. thirty years later the remastered cd finally comes around and through the fan club at [...](which i heartily recommend because of their labors of love) i bought this and balance of power (review coming). i have to say i was a little scared to put this on again after all this time as my tastes of music have evolved and the label of pretentious has been placed on them by my 16 year old son ( a prog rocker nonetheless). a big sigh of relief--the cd holds the same joys it did before. the moog synthesizer riff by jeff lynne in turn to stone still pumps the heart while sweet talking woman and songs like wild west hero and jungle still delight. but i'm amazed at how things like the concerto for a rainy day (four songs including mr. blue sky--still the brightest jewel on this album) still hold together and songs like stepping out and sweet is the night step up to dig their hooks into you even today. while the remastering is very good and makes some tunes step up (across the border's horns beg you to crank them up) there are a few drop outs (night in the city has a couple) and of course my tastes probably don't translate to everyone. but my 16 years old has given the album a careful listen and he hasn't returned it to me yet--i imagine for the next few weeks i'll still enjoy listening to out of the blue from downstairs for a few more weeks..

" edited: it took me a while to enjoy listening to this whole album since i am used to listening to her recent work - afterglow & surfacing. this is truly an outstanding album and definitely overlooked. in my opinion this ranks as the 3rd best sarah mclachlan album with #1 fumbling towards ecstasy and #2 afterglow -- even though surfacing outsold these 2 albums. i can't say much about the album because some of the reviews here say what i would say for this album as well. drawn to the rhythm: 5/5 into the fire: 5/5 the path of thorns (terms): 5/5 - first song from solace i heard. truly unique than the rest since she sings at a lower range. i will not forget you: 5+/5 - love it my #1 favorite of all her songs on this album. lost: 4.5/5 (this is a first for sarah mclachlan to have male background singers singing - edited: actually this would be the third as her 1st album touch had male bg singers for the tracks trust and strange world) back door man: 5/5 - i truly enjoy this song this song sort of reminds me of stupid from afterglow. i love her intense voice and wish she could do more songs like this. shelter: 5/5 - really sad and it's actually the second solace song i heard after 'path' black: 5+/5 - this is my second favorite song. all in all deep lyrics dedicated to corporate pigs as sarah says. one of her first experimental songs after touch. home: 5/5 - this is also another good song probably the 3rd i love. i just love how the song ends. it actually sounds better live since the instruments overlap her singing. mercy: 5/5 - i consider this the last song from the album. wyllh doesn't do it for me and i'm disappointed sarah let arista have it their way. oh well. sarah should do more acapella-like songs! this truly displayed her skills and got even better in the next album ;) overall rating: 9.5/10 outstanding album i wish it had more praise ",positive

" i was a big fan of this band's song rock'n'roll highschool and i recently saw the documentary about them so when i saw this anthology selling for around $15 in australia i thought i'd take a punt by buying it. my thoughts on this album are similar to the ones i had for the 3 cd johnny o'keefe collection [reviewed at this site by me]. namely overall the album is very listenable with some standout tracks. as with the jok album this album is/was great value for money considering how many songs you get for the price. of the songs i particularly like on this album and the ones i have been listening to quite a bit are: rock'n'roll high school. this song still rocks after all these years. do you remember rock'n'roll radio? good song though it never got the airplay that the previous song seemed to get here in australia. chinese rock. an easter egg song!! never heard this song before but it is an instant classic. very catchy. danny says. another easter egg song. takes some repeated listening to get into but once you do that it gets high rotation on your cd player. to me i can see why the ramones are considered founders of punk. at least as far as the music is concerned. however the sex pistols truly define punk for me. they have the whole package which i identify with punk...namely the punk sound and the incendiary anarchistic lyrics. the ramones are more middle-class sounding to my ears at least. i'm surprised at how poppy/boppy the ramones are. to me they sound like a punk motown band. one of the songs on the 2nd cd i think has that classic punk sound but i didn't make a note of the title. might have to edit that song in later...could be endless vacation? lastly the song danny says almost comes across as a punk beach boys song. overall the anthology is often 'samey' but listenable nonetheless with a handful of songs that i consider 'high rotation' worthy. just remembered endless vacation seems a terrific song too. will have to listen to that some more-i've currently got the 1st cd in my cd player. p.s. listened to this song last night. really good-the fast talking bit in the song reminds me of the equally good if not better song by australian act tism [or this is serious mum]-[he'll never be an] ol' man river about river phoenix amongst other people. tism like the ramones can do bad taste well.

" even though mitchell wanted to feel reckless in this album she accomplished one thing with her music: coming closer to weather report. it's obvious she loved its jazz-fusion and admired jaco pastorious and wayne shorter so much to have invited them to reach their peaks but as master musicians they could only achieved what joni allowed them to do. in paprika plains (a song over 16 min. long) joni unloads wonderful lyrics but only allows her group of pioneers to explode at the last two and half minutes. i would have hoped to hear a longer and more robust instrumental finish worthy of weather report's reputation. over all the album is interesting because mitchell is not afraid of going out on a very tiny limb....

" goth meets cabaret or rather gothic music influenced by cabaret. thats the best way to describe this wonderful little release by projekt. the eleven tracks here provide an introduction to the dark cabaret scene and do so quite well. the first song coin-operated boy by the dresden dolls is a great start and the cd continues onward to devious evil night together by jill tracy (which sets up a wonderful film noir mood) and on to the darker electronic dance number cabaret fortune teller by audra to a remix of knock three times on my coffin by projekt veterans black tape for a blue girl. along the way numerous other bands are covered. sam rosenthal's side project revue noir makes their debut on this cd with husky feminine vocals provided by nicki jaine who also has a solo song (pretty faces) on the cd as well. personally i loved revue noir and find nicki jaine's voice to be quite alluring but i also know some btfabg fans who dislike her vocals so you've been warned. but all in all i think anyone with a task for the dark should check out this cd. at the very least its a cheap and decent introduction to a whole new style and thats always a good thing ",positive

" i agree with the other negative review below- uninspired simply forgettable radio trash. cliched lyrics? check. muddy simple riffs? check. boring drumming with a couple of poorly played double bass kicks? check. thank god i got this in a box of cd's from a dj buddy of mine for free awhile back. if i actually paid for this crap i'd have to kill myself. judging from all the positive reviews however it seems some people at lava records or possibly the band themselves (if they're still around. i hope not.) have been trying to plug this sorry excuse for music.

" i like most of ac/dc's music but i can't stand their latest album stiff upper lip. stiff upper lip is the only ac/dc album where you can play it all the way through and not even hear one good song. stiff upper lip doesn't even come close to being as good as back in black or highway to hell. every song on it just bugs the heck out of me. listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience; but enduring all 12 of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy! the overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like highway to hell or back in black. but...those cds had variety they were semi original and they were actually pretty good. this cd is just completely worthless. i have heard some cra ppy cds in my lifetime but none of them were more pain to listen to than this. the vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on their earlier albums the music is chunky repetitive dull and boring and most of the songs sound the same. stiff upper lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band. the music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12 separate tracks. this cd is just unbelievaby terrible. it is a disgrace to this band's legacy and the band members should be embarrased by it. oh well i guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract so i guess they don't care about how awful it is anyway. all i can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible. it is a total piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to. go buy a good ac/dc cd like let there be rock high voltage powerage highway to hell or back in black. stiff upper lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise. it's so awful i'd rather listen to the new nickelback cd than this!

" i purchased my first weill recordings in 1960 the off-broadway threepenny opera and lenya's berlin theater songs. i have treasured them all my life. lenya was of course incomparable but ute lemper carries on her special genius. this new recording is as near a perfect realization of this unique masterpiece. john mauceri gives the unique orchestration nuance that even klemperer missed in his masterful kleine dreigroschenmusik. every member of the cast even the bit roles is perfect in the characterization. kollo is the first performer since harald paulsen (the origninal mackie messer) to bring all of the tradition of viennese operetta to this music. he is a miracle. macheath has subtle characteriztion hitherto unknown except from paulsen. most noteworthy is the jenny of milva. two delightful bonuses in the recording: a reprise in act 2 of seerauber jenny by milva (the jenny) and the inclusion of lucy brown's aria after the jealousy duet. there is brief dialog before most pieces which adds a dramatic integrity to the recording. i cannot find high enough praise for this new treasure ",positive

" ah yes it's nirvana's nevermind cd released in 1991. i listen to all 80's pop-metal or hair metal (whitesnake winger van halen y&t dokken) i could go on forever on 80's bands. (of course there is rick springfield and john cougar mellencamp). i am a true rocker here i know all the true bands out there i know everything about them. i have reasons for this. but here's the bottom line. nirvana was a breakthough along with soundgarden and pearl jam back in the early 90's. millions of people bought those cds. and yes there were hair bands still alive back then like poison and firehouse etc. firehouse and poison had alot of success eventhough it wasn't the 80's anymore. as i can see alot of my fellow rockers don't really like nirvana or pearl jam or soundgarden. to be completely honest i like their music i just don't prefer the music because i don't like the hard sound. i really like the glam-hair band style. people say: nirvana and those other grunge bands killed glam-metal. yes i agree that they killed the 80's hair bands but it's not necessarly their fault. it's a mix between the bands and the people listenting to the music. because of grundge music today's music is quite horrifying with emo and other types of music that would've been a nightmare back in those days. nirvana has a great cd here but i just don't prefer it. if you are a real rocker you'll listen to all the types of music back then. don't judge unless you have actually heard it because you may actually like it. to all rockers- don't listen to modern music. it's poisoning our people and no one really understands the true meaning of the guitar in today's music. most of you will understand what i mean so listen to the classics. classic rock and hair bands forever and even grunge. keep the classic alive. ~the sicilian axe ma ",positive

" in boyz ii men's sophomore album ii they make attempts to create their own identities with writing and producing this time around escaping producer dallas austin and founder michael bivins. this lp begins with the deepest of gratitude on thank you produced by the group and dallas austin. both all around the world and u know are mid-tempo tracks with a hip-hop flavor to them but neither of the two is strikingly memorable or highlights. one thing they do is provide another angle for boyz ii men. for a more relaxing environment vibin' has a rather simple instrumentation lyrics and vocals. i sit away is a hidden gem with a mid-tempo flow with soothing lyrics written by tony rich and production by veteran l.a. reid and tony rich. stepping into a more modern jazz feel jezzebel strengthen the groups range and abilities as the album is nearing a completed overall goal. over a piano solo boyz ii men harmonize on khilil (interlude) to shift the gears down to their overpowering abilities to formulate ballads that begins with trying times written and produced by wanya morris tim kelley & bob robinson. hit maker babyface lends a hand on two of the thirteen track album with smash singles and highlights i'll make love to you and water runs dry. heavyweights jimmy jam & terry lewis add a touch of love and mood setting material on on bended knee. 50 candles drives this album to epic proportions with its thriving bass and lyrical content ...feels like one of those nights... they show and prove why for their time there are no other male groups that can compare to their beautiful harmony and range as on yesterday they perform accapella. if real talent that you seek members shawn michael nathan and wanya has uncompromising talent for any age era or time that you can enjoy for long time.

" i heard stories about michelle branch before trying out her music. and i was electrified to find out that there is still a young honest and rock-ish female artist out there working her way up. first off all i'd like to say i wish to remain objective to all other listeners' opinion so yup...criticism is welcomed. i'd like to let people know what kind of a viewer is writing this particular review too. basically my main influences are bon jovi the goo goo dolls and elo. i'm a 17-year-old male. hotel paper is one big step for michelle. she evidentally matured her music between spirit room and this. michelle is pretty much at the state where she can't really make big steps on her own. and that's why i think her authorities are limiting her potentials by pushing her to mainstream. like the fact that she wrote so many catchy boring and good-to-sell singles that won't last and are only appealing to listerners on the shallow side. although some of her songs made me perfectly convinced that she can write decent music.(tuesday morning drop in the ocean hotel paper) some peeps are saying how michelle isn't quite a super songwriter nor a guitarist. i agree. imo many of her riffs are boring and unoriginal. even a noob guitarist like me could tell. but afterall it's pop so that's inevitable. but she could do much much better than that. her lyrics are ok since she doesn't write no emo nor punk junk but a lot of complaining and childish relationships. most are ok though. what i'm saying is she most definetly has her own style...but sadly it's surpressed at an extent where it's irritating and makes me feel like killing those studio dudes that are spending way too much time laying their hands on michelle's music. nevertheless just because michelle is young and writes her own songs and plays the guitar doesn't mean you gotta try her music out. but sadly that's exactly how a lot of people out there got attracted. i believe it's more about how you like the music. i can't stress the fact that michelle is a musician with great potential and future. but to me it seems like she's throwing those away for popularity. one good example is as prolly you've already heard...the posing for a men's magazine named m----. whatever she was thinking it really crushed my impressions on michelle...the cute musical lady she used to be....and the terrible decision of forming a pseudo-country rock band with her friend. michelle is talented and hella good compared to the other you-know-who female artists but let's get real here...she has a long way to go. she most certainly is capable of going far and i really do hope one day i'll be listening to her matured and true music. afterall imo it's only the matter of time before she surpasses amanda marshall on my list. i really hope michelle could get out of this situation and unchain from this game the studio peeps are playing on her and make every song and every note the way she always wants to. tuesday morning 3.5/5 hotel paper 4/5 the rest are just mediocre ",negative
" i purchased this disk along with others to play in my acura dvd-a system. i found the overall audio quality to be a bit disappointing...and the mix to be a bit over the top with surround effects. major vocals coming from rear speakers etc. i also found the overall sound to lack the brightness and crispness on this specific disk. in fact the demo disk for my tl has the marvin gaye song let's get it on and it is remarkably brighter on that disk than on this collection. if you are looking for dvd-a disks with 5.1 surround...i'd pass on this one and maybe purchase the cd of this album.

" yes there may be some small issues with the sound quality but you get used to it and wilhelm kempff is definitely one of the great pianists of the 20th century so it is worth it. these are incredible performances that are often justly called definitive. kempff seems to always bring out every theme of every work and magnifies its emotional intensity whereas other pianists would not have nearly as much attention to detail and neglect many subtle themes. highly recommended ",positive

" throb was my introduction to jazz back in '69 or '70. i have listened to it all of these years on lp then cd and it never lost its charm. steve swallow was just as nutty then as he is now chickens is my favorite cut. the play between electric violinist richard greene and guitarist jerry hahn is a thing of beauty. hahn is still a player who can put just the right note in just the right place (like that other countrified genius of jazz bill frisell) he can fuzz and wah-wah then tinkle the strings just right to make his musical point. one interesting thing is the organ playing by burton on throb besides his vibes. the jarrett-burton album also has hahn and swallow and drummer bill goodwin --it is very much an album that shows all the new ideas sprouting in music. fortunately the ideas of that time did not die out but have continued to grow making room for all sorts of fusions in jazz many of which have been remarkable to experience. these two-lps-in-one is like having a superstar album before they became superstars. as i said before i still play this cd after almost 35 years and i still get a kick out of it and still find things that amaze me ",positive

" lead singer and co-founder david gates was recently inducted into the songwriters hall of fame. this album is one prime example of why. david has consistently provided beautiful melodies with easy sensitive lyrics. his last album was a country album called &quot;love is always seventeen&quot; which was a genre-crossing mix of pop and country co-produced and performed with billy dean. but back to this gem. &quot;guitar man&quot; and &quot;aubrey&quot; were the big hits off of this album and they still stand the test of time. &quot;tecolote&quot; is one of their most unusual departures and still makes me laugh while enjoying its musicality and orignality. &quot;didn't even know her name&quot; is a poignant lost love song; &quot;welcome to the music&quot; is one of those opening songs bands sometimes did to orient their fans to what to expect. even larry knechtel gets in on the vocals with the intriguing &quot;picture in my mind.&quot; it's a great album---in fact there's not a bad &quot;bread&quot; album out there! enjoy and relive those magical moments of the glorious seventies ",positive
" this is an amazing ep - one of boards of canada's strongest to date. honestly i didn't enjoy dayvan cowboy that much on campfire headphase but since it has been recontectualized on trans canada highway i'm a huge fan of the song. the new tracks are more like what one would typically expect from boards of canada. warm fuzzy mellow lush analogue synths and plenty of them! for those who weren't as taken with the newer boc sound on campfire headphase assuage your fears - this is definitely a return to the traditional sound. that's not to say though that this is a rehash of old material. one can hear bits and pieces of geogaddi and such but the overall feel is much closer to music has the right to children. to all boards of canada fans - buy this without hesitation. it doesn't matter what you thought of campfire - this is quality. i have one question. the title trans canada highway seems to be a fairly obvious reference to kraftwerk's legendary trans europe express and the album cover seems to point to kraftwerk's autobahn album cover but i don't hear any explicit musical connection. is boards of canada paying a simple titular tribute to kraftwerk or is there something else buried within? this calls for repeated listenings ",positive

" it was my full belief that the next time we would hear from buju banton on an album would be on the now 2 years anticipated `rasta got soul' album. the album which has still yet to arrive (and may never) was said to be along buju's best and might actually rival his seminal classic `til shiloh. he even tipped his hand 2 years ago by releasing the album's first single the `magical' magic city. so the world was waiting to see just how much soul the album had. however. between then and now buju has been going through so many events that this album too bad almost seems like a smack in the face to his critics. forever it seems that he is still living in the `boom bye bye curse' and having some legal matters which prevented him traveling he apparently has been angered by all the unwanted attention and the result is too bad. the album has a severe kick to it it can actually sit not too far away from his `stablemate' assassin's infiltrate from `05 in terms of style. the attraction here is actually the subject of `confusion'. while we were waiting for a massive roots album to come down the pipe buju hasn't made a pure dancehall album in a very very long time. thus the dj who was once the dancehall's main attraction stepping back into the fray isn't at all a bad thing. so fans who sit longing for the days of stamina daddy and batty rider are the one's who'll be happy and i can fit into that camp as well! but at the same time buju's concentration for the last decade or so has been the roots so now it is there where he will ultimately excel. however with the current trend in dancehall to revive older riddims you may find yourself feeling like 1991 all over again. the best tune here is probably the hard hard `til it bend. til it bend is serious serious rudey dancehall. the song might sound like the rest to the untrained ear but i guarantee that is the song most jamaican will pull up til it bend is nice! also check the wicked wicked nothing who have it? the ultra clever better day and the nice hey boy over the petty thief riddim. however my second favorite song here i would have to say would be the combination don & dupes with underrated dancehall singer pinchers who has been making a very very nice return to the scene recently largely due to his connection with madhouse head dave kelly. buju makes an attempt (for some reason) at the useless wipeout riddim on me & unu and actually makes it work a little. also check when things slow down on nice tunes such as driver which is easily one of the best tunes on the album. overall the thought alone buju doing another dancehall album may have some salivating and some wondering where the roots is this one may appeal to both group of hardcore fans. while there is nothing here that i would call definitive roots reggae this album has such an old school vibes to it that anyone who has ever been a fan of buju's will find something they like. i would have like to have seen buju have at least one lenky riddim on the album a wayne wonder combination (although pinchers subs just fine) and definitely the massive song beauty queen from the twice again riddim would have fit just fine here but nevertheless what you do have: high quality dancehall from one of the greatest architects of that skill is just fine and too bad over both what beenie and baby cham have done is the best pure dancehall album of 2006 to date and a boomshot in the arm for the genre ",positive

" i will state first off that i'm one of those hipster snobs who dismiss pearl jam's debut album ten as the whining chart-whoring pseudo-anthemizing overpriced-flannel-flying watered-down-grungifying crowd-surfer-pandering piffle that it is. if you think that makes me inherently biased (unbalanced?) this review probably won't be helpful to you and you can move on the other 250 or so reviews. if you decide to hear me out i promise to be fair 'cause even though i may be a hipster snob i can't deny to myself the sweet rockin' going on in vitalogy. this album represents one the best meeting points between what was then called underground or indie rock and the classic rock mainstream. thus the production quality is raw when it needs to be but polished enough so it doesn't sound sloppy. ballads like better man and its companion piece nothingman are clearly influenced by neil young and even nebraska-era springsteen--they're sincere & emotional but not mushy & sentimental. not for you with it's lyrics about how eddie vedder's small table has been invaded by uninvited hordes is a none-too-subtle complaint about pearl jam's status as millions served rock gods and a longing for the more stripped-down aesthetic of punk. that of course is more directly the point of spin the black circle an old-fashioned punk barnstormer that sounds like a close cousin to sst-era husker du. for vedder the joys of vinyl are that they seem warmer--a symbol of tradional values in a rock 'n' roll sense: independence hard work and homespun crafts are better than the shiny sterile corporate plastic of compact discs. never mind the fact that vinyl was just as much a product of corporate culture; vedder just feels a pleasing wave of childhood nostalgia cradling a 12 record sleeve in his arms and watching a needle bury itself into those mysterious black grooves. pearl jam may be in many ways traditionalists who long for the simple joys of just playing for the kids without corporate interference. on the other hand the big corporate evil has enabled them to reach a huge audience which in turn helped them finance the elaborate packaging of vitalogy--it's designed as a salute/satire of a very old hardcover book advising youths on good physical/mental/spiritual hygeine. the album therefore aims to strike a balance between the fondly-remembered rock stars of the band's own youth (the who neil young) and the more recent indie-punks that re-sparked their interest in the power of rock (fugazi sonic youth)--hence the title. the album is perhaps unnecessarily padded out with unfinished or noveltly tracks like bugs and hey foxymophandlemama that's me even though they're intended to give the album a looser and more light-hearted feel. still some of the songs that work the best are gloomy ones like last exit and the somewhat proggy sea chanty tremor christ (whose title i dearly hope is meant more as metaphor than an endorsement). even though it's uneven vitalogy is the work of a self-reliant even ornery band that's in full control of their ideas--even the bad ones. it's also not their fault that they influenced the likes of true bottom-feeding whores like stone temple pilots and matchbox 20.

" i ordered mine from here (amazon marketplace) a couple weeks ago and i'm a very happy camper. this is one of the best online purchases i've made in a long long time! first of all there are songs i've never heard before so by owning this compilation it helps me get to know the band's material or siobhan's own solo stuff much better. all the songs are very well-written and catchy. thanks to my best friend he drew me toward's ss's music back in the 90's with the hormonally yours cd. ss's music was always something i pushed to the back burner because i didn't know what to make of it. but in the past 2 years i've focused on the new material from the shakespears sister #3 album...and it blew me away! siobhan is a true musical genius! i don't care seems to be a differnt version. it's much brighter & fresher-sounding than the album version. wow! hello (turn your radio on) is my favorite ss song of all time & also appears to be a different version. just hearing the first notes from it my eyes got all teary. it's just the way i am regarding this song. the clock ticking at the end reminds me of a heartbeat or something. dark songs like this draw me near. lol the compilation is missing one song bitter pill. i wanted & hoped for this song to be released on the cd but unfortunately it didn't make it. awwww! the liner notes booklet is packed with all lyrics cool photos and a fine page of background regarding the recordings of their albums. siobhan is one cool gal! i love the front & back artwork for it is both amusing colorful & dramatic. i'm a sucker for dramatic stuff like this. hopefully siobhan will continue recording lots of new material using the shakespears sister title. i despise the crap we hear on the radio nowadays. hopefully now that sf has released this package the music will get more airplay. i like the nostalgic aspect of music from a decade ago because it reminds us of how the music industry used to be non-commercial and fun. yes...it's too bad that siobhan and marcella broke up because their 2 uniquely different voices complimented one another. there hasn't been a duo like them since! my thoughts on the dvd... i love it! the first & only video clip i've ever seen from ss is stay. totaly blew me away since the first time i saw it. i've always loved seeing siobhan as death in her starry crown & black glitzy outfit. she makes the perfect female version of death. i could never understand the video until now because i never had the chance to see the entire thing on tv. the other videos are equally great and draw me closer each time. i appreciate the chaptered menu for the videos. at least i know what's from where. the dvd was put together very well and is packed with great stuff. fortunately my dvd player on the computer and the tv can play this all-region pal dvd. i haven't experienced any difficulties (skipping tracks or anything). it all plays fine. actually when i purchased this item online the item description said ntsc format (usa & canada)...so that's why i bought it. it may not apply to everyone's purchase though. disc one (cd): 01- you're history 02- heroine 03- break my heart (you really) 04- dirty mind 05- waiting 06- goodbye cruel world 07- stay 08- i don't care 09- hello (turn your radio on) 10- i can drive 11- excuse me john 12- can u wait that long? 13- do i scare you? 14- white rabbit 15- was it something i said? disc two (dvd): 01- break my heart (you really) 02- heroine 03- run silent run deep 04- you're history 05- dirty mind (remix) 06- the russian film (featuring dirty mind & heroine live in leningrad 1988) 07- goodbye cruel world 08- stay 09- i don't care 10- catwoman (live) 11- my 16th apology (edit) 12- hello (turn your radio on) 13- i can drive additional features/info: - biography (same as on 1st page of linernotes booklet) - photo gallery with audio (music) - credits (for videos) - cd total playing time (62:03) if you're an ss fan this item is a must have! regardless the price it's definitely worth owning! thank you amazon for making this item available through your marketplace ",positive
" i was first introduced to the symphonic power metallers formerly known as rhapsody (name changed due to copyright issues) on their 2006 live album live in canada. i have to say that i am just not that impressed or entertained by their latest studio effort. the group tends to rely more or the theatrical elements rather than focusing on their metal music. the vocals tend to be oversung or drowned out by the chaos in the background. rather than enhancing your metal experience with musical theatrical elements rhapsody of fire puts you to sleep with them. the group does stay true to their fantasy themes however ",negative
" i'm a horn performance major and i bought this box set because i needed recordings of all of beethoven's symphonies but at a low cost. now first off yes they sound great. however i've noticed a problem in the first movement of the fifth symphony: karajan changes beethoven's orchestration! allow me to explain: the horn players at the time would have been using valveless horns -- instruments bound to the overtone series. on the natural or hand horn pitches that fall on the overtone series can be played without adjustment (like a bugle) but any other note must be bent into tune by using the right hand to close off the bell. this technique was effective in allowing the horn to play most chromatic pitches however the stopped notes have an entirely different tone color; most composers favored open pitches especially for symphonic works. in the exposition the second theme is announced by a call in e-flat by the horns. however in the recap the same call must be in the tonic (c) as dictated by sonata form. the horn part is written for e-flat horns which meant they would have been tuned so that the harmonic series emphasised e-flat major the relative major. the e-flat call of the exposition falls entirely on partials the hornists can play with no significant adjustment -- they are all open notes. however in the recapitulation the c call would include two closed notes if it were played by the e-flat horn. the horns could change crooks and become c horns in which case the call would again be all open partials but beethoven does not do this; i am uncertain whether he wanted the horns in e-flat for the transition leaving them no time to change or if it was simply not yet common practice to change crooks in the middle of a movement. for whatever reason beethoven left the horns in e-flat and rather than writing the call in the horns again which would include stopped pitches and have a very different sound beethoven moved the call to the bassoons. in karajan's recording the second theme is announced by the horns in both the exposition and the recapitulation. granted if beethoven had been writing for our modern valve horns he might have written both calls in the horn section. there is no way to prove for certain that this is the case however. it strikes me as very arrogant to correct beethoven's instrumentation and i feel that a respect for historical accuracy by preserving the master's writing is a more prudent performance choice.

" dj shadow is in my honest opinion one of the most overlooked artists in music today. threading the thin line between commercial and underground and finding his niche somewhere in between (as unkle says the middle ground between light and shadow) dj shadow continues to impress with every release he puts forth. i was fortunate enough to pick this album up right after its release and actually purchased it before i bought endtroducing which is by far dj shadow's best album and one of the best albums ever made. by sampling elements from just about anywhere shadow combines elements from our pop culture to create mini-movies of his songs which few artists can touch in terms of sheer production value and the emotional effect that is created while listening to his music. i am actually glad i bought this album before endtroducing as it has given me the time to truly appreciate this album for what it is; a work of art and a continual growing of shadow's talents. had i bought endtroducing before this and writtwn a review i'm sure i would have garnered it with a 4 star review but that is simply not the case here. while endtroducing is always going to be leaques above and beyond this album josh davis has found a way here to go above and beyond what should be expected of an album and given us an album that i'm sure years from now i will still find elements in it that will grow even more on me with time. best enjoyed while driving or relaxing at home (possibly with a little mary in tow if you know what i mean) the songs fluctuate with peaks and valleys of highs and lows and the beats are flawless especially when compared to a lot of the mainstream garbage that is put out in the record industry on a regular basis. see the thing is that shadow bases his music upon how he feels and artists that do this correctly achieve an emotional reaction from their music that the true artists of our world truly achieve. radiohead for example has a way of doing this and it is not surprising then that one of dj shadows favorite artists is radiohead they both fuse these elements into their music and achieve monumental status in my opinion. the package design is equally well done as well showing an artists eye for presentation and a graffiti influenced design to the overall package. if you enjoy this album then i highly recommend any of shadows works: endtroducing preemptive strike the private press and in tune and on time which is a live set recorded in support of this album. unkle is also a well thought out album which bridges the gap between hip-hop rock and techno with guest appearences by mike d of the beastie boys thom yorke from radiohead and others from throughout the music industry. if you've never heard of dj shadow before then i must say that you are missing out if you are at all interested in underground music do yourself a favor and pick up any of shadow's albums or collaborations i guarantee you will extremely impressed as with any good album the songs have a way of growing on you over time. peace out ",positive
" although it kills me to write anything less than glowing about edwin mccain (i think he's probably the most talented singer/songwriter we've seen in the last ten years) i just can not get into this album. like others have said i too have every edwin album and have seen him in concert. i love everything he's ever done.... but this album just doesn't do it for me. and i know people will say... give the album a chance..... or... let edwin grow and move in new musical directions. but..... i've listened to this album at least 10 times all the way through and it's just not growing on me. it feels flat and just doesn't feel edwin-ish (if that makes any sense). even grammercy park hotel which i saw him debut live and which is on his live dvd doesn't feel the same on here.... just doesn't have the feeling or soul. i would pick up austin sessions over this album any day. that is edwin doing what he does best. maybe he feels the pressure to write some hits so that he doesn't have to spend two solid years on the road in the black pearl (his tour bus)..... and who could blame him??? but this feels like he's trying too hard. i soooooo hope he comes back with a better album next time so i can rave about it because although i gave this album 2 stars.... edwin as a person/singer/performer/songwriter deserves 10!!!!!!

" i have seen al jarreau 20 times in concert (and recently saw al and george perform at the hollywood bowl) and am a long-time fan from way back. there are a few al cds that you just play forwards and backwards (and back when they were cassettes you wore out the tape) because they're just perfect. breakin' away jarreau and heaven and earth come to mind. well add givin' it up to that list. if you're an old-school al fan and you're wondering whether to buy this cd buy it. it will live up to all of your al expectations. there's a look the rainbow feel to it there's a breakin' away feel to it there's a jarreau feel to it. there's even a glow feel to it (when you think about tunes like milwaukee and have you seen the child?). grassroots al. it's got the production values of heaven and earth and tenderness. fabulous production arrangements gathering of talent. there is not one song on here that you will skip as you're listening to it driving to work or whatever. in fact if you're throwing a party and want to instantly get people in a jazzy party mood put on this cd because between everybody from chris botti to jill scott to a soulful paul mccartney people will stop and say wow listen to jill and george tearing up 'god bless the child.' and is that paul mccartney tearing up 'bring it on home to me'? [yes it is.] meanwhile al and george are working their magic the entire time and guests will say listen to george right there. and al is jamming right now. it's a conversation-stopper provided by the best thing that can stop a conversation at a party: fabulous music that people must comment on. of course that's where the conversation picks right back up so you win either way. the blend is perfect: just a touch of scatting just a touch of voice-beat with lots of fabulous jazzy vocals by both al and george tons of great music solos and george playing a perfect guitar. if you're a george benson fan you will be thrilled with this cd because george provides a fabulous through-line to every piece. he's ever-present with every wonderful thing he ever did on a guitar. he fronts many of the pieces and he's not in any way relegated to background guitarist. he is the music in every piece with few exceptions. as much as i love al this cd is magical because of the blend of george and al. only these two can pair up to make this kind of cd. there is no other team who could have pulled this off. you need al's voice and george's guitar. period. in fact i'm guessing much of the jazz music world is a tad jealous right now of how simply genius this cd is as in dang. these two are great together. wow. bottom line: this is a perfect blend of these two greats' talents. george takes care of the music while al provides the wide gamut of vocals he's an expert at (and that only he can provide). if you've been a long-time fan of either of these two you won't be disappointed. it's not lopsided. and it's old-school in every good way. my prediction: this cd will sweep the grammys. if it doesn't there is no justice. like another reviewer on this page i intend to buy this cd for about eight people. it's just that perfect ",positive

" after leaving (or being dismissed from) pink floyd in 1968 due to his lsd use & erratic behaviour singer/songwriter/guitarist syd barrett re-emerged in 1970 with his debut solo album the madcap laughs. the album did not come easy as syd never fully recovered from his drug use and it clearly shows in his ragged performances on madcap laughs. producer malcolm jones did what he could with syd for about half of the album before handing the production reigns over to barrett's former floyd mates roger waters & david gilmour to finish the job. throughout the album bum notes are played beats are missed and barrett sings off-key. and on the rocker songs the session players (from the group the soft machine) sound like they are struggling to keep up with syd who could hit a rough patch at any moment. for any other artist this would all be nothing short of disastrous. and yet....in the case of syd barrett any and all mistakes are immediately forgiven. why? because barrett's songs on the madcap laughs are all wonderfully written and although syd's voice and guitar-playing are obviously not in tip-top condition you can plainly hear on this album that he's trying. he's really really *trying* to do his best and his efforts really do shine through. for every bum note there's a passage that syd plays beautifully for every missed beat there are many beats that are hit right on schedule and for every note that syd sings off-key there are many moments where his very distinctive british voice is magical. and of course there's syd's lyrics. you may not know what all of them actually *mean* really but to my ears they're still poetry. the rockers are still powerful (no good trying no man's land the rockabilly fun of here i go and the classic octopus) and the softer numbers still have great beauty to them (terrapin the passionate dark globe the effective golden hair---based on a james joyce poem---and long gone). even the more ragged numbers like feel and if it's in you somehow still hang together quite well (amusingly we even hear some brief banter from syd in the middle of if it's in you as his voice goes wildly off the map he stops playing prepares for another take and finally gets through the song). when all is said and done the madcap laughs warts and all is an excellent album. it is a flawed masterpiece and it shows that syd barrett even with his mind irreversibly fractured by this point was still a genius musician.

" to be honest i can't think of a word that can explain the emotional link with this album apart from it being the most beautiful sound i've heard. for me listening to this album makes me feel emotionally confused but absolutely complete at the same time never before has an album stopped me in my tracks as firmly as this one. my favourite songs on the album are the only moment we were alone and six days at the bottom of the ocean every time my ears are blessed with these artworks i'm am fixated on nothing else but them. i literally cannot communicate with anyone or anything i just have to listen to them intently. this album is not as experimental as those who tell the truth shall die those who tell the truth shall live forever but i feel it is just as good and the songs are put together impeccably well with no song being neither longer nor shorter than it has to be. i love the pure clean sound of this album and see it as light as the wind. the trance that this album provides is indescribable; i'm not saying if you buy this album it will have this exact effect on you this description is merely from a personal note. either way i strongly recommend this band and album to anybody who is looking for a purchase for you can have no doubt that this album is extremely well produced written recorded thought out and sounding. buy it you will not regret your choice one bit.

" i am very disappointed in this cd. not because the music isn't good because it is. but because it is just not the pat green that used to play in stillwater. the passionate soulful pat green. back then he sang about things that he believed in and loved. now he is singing what nashville tells him to. and this coming from the guy who sang nashville sucks with cory morrow. there are a ton of country singers out there that could have released this cd and it would have sounded exactly the same. but songs like southbound 35 and three day can only be sang by pat green. he needs to revisit his roots and come back to the red dirt country music that he was born to play. will the real pat green please stand up ",negative

" sometimes i like to look up and see what i can find on some of my favorite bands from the 70's and starz being one of them. i was lucky enough to see the band play a few times around 77 and 78. another band that took time for their fans!!!!!!! i read through the many reviews of posted here on amazon and not sure if there is much that i can add also great to see that there were so many out there that enjoyed the band and their music. i would recommend reading about each of the starz cd's and listening to the sound files if available and deciding for yourself........ i remember i liked this cd so much and the logo as well i even hand- made a stencil and made my own starz shirt i think i used some of that gold glue on glitter in a tube and had one of the first starz shirts before the band even had any if i remember right. lots of good songs on this cd pull the plug being one of my favorites both on the lp/cd and live. all good rock songs from a band that deserved a lot more......... i could go on trying to describe the music.......... too bad there are no sound files for this cd....... so you may just have to order it and take a chance. the remaining members have played a few shows during the past year or so and guitar player richie ranno continues to be active in the music business you may even want to go over to starzcentral to get updated and see what richie and the band are up to. singer michael lee smith also had a brother that had his own band and later ventured into hollywood....... but this is about starz!!!...so.... i highly recommend checking out the cd's and starzcentral. not to be confused with the movie channel or another band from europe that is using the name recently ",positive

" the lack of someone lurking behind prince's shoulder while in the recording studio and having the courage to tell him when he produces second rate nonsense has been missing since the departure of the fargnoli management team. this is a poor track incorporating biblical references that have little relevance or sense of genuine compassion to the katrina disaster. musically the lack of emotion conveyed by the unnecessarily complicated chord changes and irrelevant reference to sade also make the feel of this track disjointed. while prince fans will generally hype this track the reality is that 4 the tears in your eyes this isn't and to add a charity track with an instrumental showing off your musical skills is just pure self indulgence and frankly crass. lets hope this is not an indication of the upcoming 3121.

" i love this show! that said i do not care for this version of it. the inclusion of the word concept in the title means it is just that. this was thankfully not the final version of the show that would later spawn the hit song one night in bangkok. with most broadway musicals the musical numbers tell the basic story of the show. if you listen to the recordings of phantom mama mia beauty and the beast you can discern the basic storyline of the show. listening to this particular recording of chess though will leave you wondering what was that? the broadway arrival of chess saw a much needed reworking of the storyline and arrangement of the musical numbers. this recording seems too much like a mish-mash of songs that don't really relate to each other. for musical fanatics (like myself) i say yes you should have this recording in your collection if only to understand how much work went into the show before it opened on broadway. if you are only buying the album because of one night in bangkok purchase the broadway recording instead; you'll be much happier with the performance by phillip casnoff rather than murray head ",negative
" a lot of people are meriting ja's credibility on all his albums because he has been able to keep his voice on the airwaves since 1998. so he released his sophomore album rule 3:36 in sept 2000 that is one of the worst ja albums i've heard (not the worst the last temptation takes that title). ja tries to be gangstafied on this album but fails terribly. starting with the first single me & you thinking his thug style can attract women. i haven't bought the concept in 2000 and i'm still not buying it six years later. or how about the flat falling track f*** you featuring vita and 01? or as many revewers have pointed out that he tries to boast his singing vocals on this album which seriously damages his creditablity. how about the song put it on me before lil mo joined song. sounds wack(er) with out her. or how about the late barry white imitation on the song extacy (and thats one of the decent tracks on this album). oh and remember when between me & you was highly antacipated that you downloaded the single on napster? well do you remember that the origonal/demo that some of you downloaded didn't have christina millian singing the hook but had ja singing it himself. thank god that wasn't on the album. now there are some listenable tracks on this album that i would like to point out. 6 feet is a standout track and is possibly the best track on this album and my personal favorite. watching me is another tight track as ja spits with a load of energy within him. i cry and as mentioned earlier extacy are decent at best. other than that most of the tracks on this album are skippable. overall a sub medicore ja rule album. most of the 4 and 5 star reviewers are either big time ja rule fans or just in love with mainstream overrated rap (put it on me [remix]). to me this album is nothing else but a pop rap falsafied thug rap album that just doesn't appeal to me. i recommend this to hardcore ja rule fans if they don't have this already. lyrics: c production: c+ guest appearances: c- musical vibes: d- favorite tracks: watching me 6 feet die extacy honorable mention track : chris black (skit ",negative

" horizon was a turning point in the recording career of the carpenters--a more sophisticated sound more suited to karen's rich and warm voice. but the album was rather short and some of the songs just weren't up to the standards expected by their fans which was reflected in the sales of the album which was their slowest selling album up to that point. the opening aurora and the closing eventide (the same melody with different lyrics) nicely bookend the album and aurora provides the first hint that this was not the average carpenters album. only yesterday follows; this beautiful and uptempo song begins as a dolorous downbeat ballad before segueing into the cheerful refrain. the cover of desperado is well done but ultimately it is lost between the flashy tracks before and after it. please mr. postman is infectuously happy fluff; it has absolutely no depth but is irresistable while it's playing and will have you singing along with karen. the big-band era i can dream can't i? reveals the new depths of karen's voice and the small jazz combo ensures that she is the focus of the listener. the third and final single from this album solitaire begins the second half of the album on a (metaphorical) high note. the remaining full tracks (happyi'm caught between goodbye and i love you and love me for what i am) are all less-than-captivating songs that greatly benefit from karen's reading and richard's arrangements ",positive

" earlier i had an lp called best of the band that was 10 cuts and maybe 35 minutes. this is 18 well chosen cuts and double the length. there are a lot of best of/greatest hits type collections from veteran artists that originally came out in 70's or early 80's that had a limited number of songs and length. this is a case where the record decided to offer more songs and give the customer a better value for their money. the music itself is 5 stars and they were a major artist due to the fact that they had 3 very good but very different lead vocalists handling the vocals. it gives the music a lot more variety and they put out a lot of fine music in their 1968-76 prime. as an aside 3 of the band members (helm danko and hudson) also put out some good music in the 1990's ",positive
" hounds is an outstanding piece of work. two outstanding pieces of work if you look at it properly. the first consisting of five individual songs though all with a very similar feel and texture. the second is a conceptual set of songs called the ninth wave which has had many meanings read into it. all five tracks from the first piece are excellent. the opening track running up that hill is possibly kate's greatest single of all time (up there with wuthering heights and babooshka) it is a powerful song with simple but highly emotional lyrics. it has been reworked by aussie outfit infusion in recent years and become a big dance floor anthem for the likes of john digweed and dj tiesto. it had lost none of it's appeal or sense of urgency over time. the title track is a beautiful upbeat song. again it has made a resurgence in the last year thanks to mod-rock uk band the futureheads. the big sky is my favourite (you want my reply? what was the question? i was looking at the big sky!). the extended mix is great and available on the 1997 emi remastered release of hounds. mother stands for comfort is a little out of place dark and eerie it would have felt right at home on the dreaming. kates vocals are in my opinion sublime on this track. the fantastic song cloudbusting nearly deserves a review on it's own. a masterpiece in modern pop it tells one of the best stories i've ever heard in a pop song and combines it with one of the best video clips i've ever seen. the ninth wave is beyond review. you need to buy this lp and listen to it over and over again. it will mean different things to different people and i think that is what makes it so amazing. commonly interpretted as the story of a woman drowning i have weaved several meanings through the story at various times of my life but each ends happily - the whimsical the morning fog makes sure of it... else just put it on and lose yourself in the soundscape read nothing into it and take the ninth wave for a musical ride. that's my favourite way to listen to it. finally if you ever need to test the ability of a piece of sound equipment say the $2000 amplifier you're about to splurge on take the remastered lp as your test. the percussion should be clear the vocals crisp and the stereo separation precise. an outstanding lp in every way!

" this is beck's coming of age album. loser was a single that was designed from the bottom up to be a hit single and mellow gold landed beck right smack center of mainstream pop culture for an entire generation. his earlier recordings featured in an album entitled one foot in the grave were evidence enough of his musical genius. mellow gold might have represented an electro-acoustic adolescence for beck. if that's the case then mutations was his rite of passage a moment of maturation that moves beyond the playful tongue-in-cheek wittiness of his previous album. mutations has dark brooding moments with haunting melodies. his lyrics inspire curiosity and sadness. in one song he sings looking back on some dead world that looks so new. we can't always be sure of his references or implications but the music in this album is fascinating and darkly beautiful. his ambiguity of language is infectious and the compositions that he rests his words in are dynamic and graceful. with mutations beck has secured an important place in music history. this is a body of work that really goes far beyond album sales and radio play. the arrival of this album shows us an artist finding a moment of clarity and touching the world with his craft.

" eloy (name taken from h g well`s time machine) is a german atmospheric progressive art rock band that was formed back in 1969. through the years personal wise the band has totally turned over in some positions several times. their originator frank bornemann (guitars/vocals) has persevered presiding over a three decade band that has turned out some of the best progressive rock music i've had the fortune to hear. ocean ocean their sixth album released in 1977 is a concept album depicting the rise and fall of atlantis. though there are only four tracks they average almost eleven minutes each. many eloy aficionados point to this album as their `tour de force'. it is excellent but as far as i'm concerned based on what i've heard so far there is no album that stands heads above the others. overall ocean has an atmospheric ambience reminiscent of hawkwind or a more unknown band that i once reviewed named ship of fools. it also reminds me jeff wayne's war of the worlds. track listing 1. poseidon's creation (11:38) **** has a long droning medium pace and a whinny guitar intro. at the 4:40 mark bornemann finally begins the vocal. there is quite a lot of guitar playing on this song augmented occasionally by the synth. 2. incarnation of the logos (8:25) **** has an atmospheric vocal beginning. the song doesn't seem to have much of a melody until the 3:40 mark when the synth/organ takes over with a pleasant one assisted by some percussion and a bell now and then. 3. decay of the logos (8:15) *** the shortest song at eight minutes seems a little jerky at first with more monologue than music. when it does get going after about three minutes it's still jerky in a medium paced beat. strong synth playing through the middle. 4. atlantis' agony at june 5th - 8498 13 p.m. gregorian earthtime (15:35) ***** this is a monster song. it is like nothing i've ever heard. except for a fifty some second monologue at the beginning atlantis... starts with a truly intriguing eight minute plus instrumental intro. not just any intro like you're used to with a full orchestra and violins. no this is an spacey atmospheric intro that would make the great pink floyd envious with the propitious use of ghostly sounds and special effects segueing into an amazing five minute organ bridge with no beat just the hammond a few side effects and you. no it doesn't get boring. instead it sets you up for the vocals which issue forth at about the eight minute mark. slowly the rhythm section establishes a slow beat while the singer does a great imitation of bob dylan with a remarkable spacey synth breaking in between the vocal. but we're not done. with about two minutes left the band picks up the tempo to a medium fast tempo (the first time i`ve heard them play at this speed). now the violins join in with the guitar and synth for the finale of this great finale. total time: 43:53 line-up - frank bornemann / guitars vocals - klaus-peter matziol / basses vocals - jrgen rosenthal / drums percussion flute - detlev schmidtchen / keyboards mellotron xylophone voice - the boys of santiago / chorus (1) conclusion one of the factors i find appealing about this band is that in the span of three decades they managed to present a style of music which was compatible with each era so listening to their albums from different periods gives us a window into the progressive music of various time periods. eloy's musical tempo almost never exceeds medium and on ocean tends to be more in the medium slow range. listening to this and other eloy albums i hear influences from numerous other bands. like many prog bands i hear pink floyd but i also hear uriah heep moody blues and bob dylan (really on track four!)

" i thoroughly enjoy this collection of hits from the mamas and the papas. every song is fun and the tunes will stay with you long after you're done listening. like other selections from the 20th century masters series this can't be called a complete collection. however what is included is fantastic and i find myself popping it into my cd player much more often than many other cds. my copy of this cd (which i bought new) includes an 8-page folder with two photos of the band (besides the cover photo) a short band biography written by joseph f. laredo and a track listing with song writing and original release credits. song lyrics are not included. the jewel case is fully transparent with another photo of the band on the inside of the back paper. as a side note if you are a fan of the abc television series lost this cd includes the mama cass song make your own kind of music that is featured on desmond's record player in the hatch. if you're just starting with the mamas and the papas or simply want a brief overview of some of their better known songs this is a great cd. for more the mamas and the papas check out criterion's phenomenal dvd release of monterey pop (or the box set the complete monterey pop festival). this concert dvd is absolutely brilliant and includes several songs from the mamas and the papas.

" i bought this album after hearing about them from a fellow beach boys fan. i'm a huge pet sounds fan but i love all kinds of orchestrated rock from the left banke to beulah. this album is not that good people. it's not even okay. there are way better takes on the brian wilson (read: phil spector) sound. whether it's the ladybug transistor or the apples in stereo. heck check out a great vancouver band called ashley park as well. the production on this is so rooted in the eighties/nineties that it's almost unlistenable. they may be good road musicians but it doesn't show on this album especially since some of tracks use lamo drum loops a la stone roses. you would be better off going through the elephant 6 label's recordings or even merge stuff. to be honest i didn't even find the compositions that scintillating regardless of the production. chord and change-wise they're interesting....but that doesn't make the songs good.

" the dreaming was one of those albums that i found in my parents cd collection when i was young and i haven't outgrown it yet. my parents seemed to hate it and never bought a kate bush cd after it (though i recently bought her whole collection except the whole story as it's just a greatest hits!). this album took me a very long time to get into however. i listened to it several times as a child and then put it away because i thought it was too strange. i took it out then several years later and loved it. i would now say it could be my all time favourite cd and is better than hounds of love as i see it. the songs all stand on their own and bush's voice is brilliant and her quirky themes shine through. this is the only album that i will never skip a track because i'm always in the mood for them all. 1. sat in your lap- a great opening track. bush deals with whether she can be bothered to do something or not. the instruments are great as always. 2. there goes a tenner- a notable song for the quirky british accent bush puts on. the instruments are very good and remind me of the '80's (as it was made then!). that was a good decade for music! 3. pull out the pin- the piano arrangement is excellent in this song and the chorus is so good. the lyrics are about someone who is in war and thinking about pulling out the pin of a grenade. the song was inspired by a documentary. 4. suspended in gaffa- i don't actually know what gaffa is but this song is still so great and catchy. the lyrics are quirky and the instrumentation is excellent. 5. leave it open- an excellent song that reminds me more of hounds of love. the instrumentation is excellent as always. 6. the dreaming- another brilliant song which is so funny because of bush's australian accent. the production is good and so is the songwriting. 7. night of the swallow- the use of irish traditional music is a nice effect to this song. the singing by bush is superb and the song is flawless! 8. all the love- the song has a sadder feel to it but is excellent. the lyrics are unusual and very well done. the instruments complement bush's superb voice and never overtake! 9. houdini- the album cover is to do with this song. the song is excellent with a really quirky chorus and good instrumentation. 10. get out of my house- a perfect way to end an amazing album. the lyrics are so good and it is so funny at the end when she turns into a mule (within the song obviously). it is something only kate bush could have written! overall i think it is an amazing album though i can see why people don't like it. it could be a little too experimental for some though for me it is perfect. kate bush shows she was the original alternative female and the best (yes she's better than tori amos). she is one of the few geniuses of music and an all time amazing artist. reccomended to everyone into alternative especially tori amos fans! mark- 10/1 ",positive

" sarah brightman is one of my all time favorite artists. but this disc is just a complete waste. it is missing so much and has too many songs that don't belong. like the phantom songs. as much as i love them save them for the andrew llyod webber collections. can't we have a nice singles collection with just her solo works starting from dive? her classics album had it right. except their version of captain nemo was the rip off live version. and this cd doesn't even have the captain nemo song which is a huge fan favorite and definitly was a single. it is also missing how can heaven love me eden harem and beautiful. all singles as well. save your money. either buy the classics album for a somewhat better compilation or just make your own mix like i did. because sarah has so many wonderful songs (and quite a few bad ones i will admit) and it seems on here they give you some bad ones (like requium and nella fantasia) and leave out the good ones. it's a beautiful day and what you never know are good but are the weakest songs form harem. why on earth would you leave out harem and beautiful but leave on beautiful day and wynk? whoever put this set list together must have not put much thought into it and is just trying to cash in. i bet sarah didn't have much say in this compilation. this is just a waste. beautiful album cover though ",negative

" just listening to the samples of this new remix of gold:35th anniversary edition ~ the carpenters i found it to be in my opinion sadly remixed very badly. certainly not a tribute to the excellent talent of karen carpenter and richard as well. i wonder what richard was thinking when he remixed these songs? as another review noticed and i agree with is the bass on some is so loud it almost drowns out the pure excellence of karen's deep resounding truly perfect voice. this is not a cd you want to get if you really want to appreciate the true pure sound of the carpenters. the older cds (if still in production or if you can find them used) carpenters classics 25th anniversary a 2 cd disc 98:04 minute collection remastered digitally is a much better pick. especially for those who remember the carpenters when karen was still alive and the original arrangements were nothing to mess with. the other cd's worth finding of the carpendters especially if you like the talent of karen's deep resounding perfect voice would be the cd voice of the heart this is a hautingly beautiful collection of love songs by karen who lets each song touch your heart and soul making you feel as if you were right there as she sings each song. the other one i would highly recommend if christmas is your holiday would be carpenters christmas portrait... special edition digital version....celebrating 70 continuious minutes of the seasons best... with karen and richard. there are 34 carpenters songs as timeless as their soundand 11 performances heard on this holiday cd for the first time. these cds are all the songs you fell in love with the first time you heard karen sing. these are the arrangements so beautifully done with her and richard. this new remix maybe ok if you have not been familiar with how wonderful the original songs the carpenter's recorded and later remastered-not remixed- sounded. for this reason i give this 35th anniversary remix a 2 star rating. these older cds are how the carpenders really won over their fans took the music industry by storm and gave a generation of music lovers reason to love the carpenders music and the sound they gave each song. talent that can still win over anyone who truly appreciates the timeless talents only the carpenters could deliver. as i more or less said in my title for this review and taken from an old saying if it ain't broke don't fix it! or in this case don't remix it!

" i've seen and heard sheryl live when she's not surrounded by rock and roll dinosaurs. she's great - she's hip self-assured and kicks butt! but here she tells the audience in leaving las vegas: i'm playing central park tonight... but i have some friends coming up so can you be patient...please? for lil' ol' me? be very patient.... almost begging the audience not to walk out while she's singing solo. it's almost as if she knows that the audience will have to suffer her solo attempts until the friends arrive. the irony is that sheryl solo is the best part of the album. with the others on board we can't see what sheryl can do and those familiar with her know that sheryl is capable of a lot. she's overwhelmed by keith richard stevie nicks eric clapton chrissie hynde and by including so many rock gods she herself is diminished in importance and stature. her songs it don't hurt and there goes the neighborhood stand out on the album showing that sheryl can rock harder and better than any of her friends. too bad she didn't include am i getting through -- the part 2 of that was a great rock moment. natalie maines' grating voice (like fingernails on a chalkboard) completely ruin strong enough. chrissie sounds like a zombie on if it makes you happy sarah mclaughlin is so hopelessly unhip and white-bread in her lilith-fair mode that she adds nothing to a difficult kind...in fact by the end of the song sarah seems to disappear from the song as sheryl belts it to the end. that's sheryl's song and should remain so tombstone blues stands out for its guitar work and the best part of all i wanna do is the new york audience. happy white room and gold dust woman are three classic rock standards so overplayed that anyone who grew up to 70's fm aor radio has heard them ad nauseaum. problem here is that nothing new is added to them they sound like karaoke versions. despite sheryl's plea for patience i was bored with the old-timers.they didn't bring sheryl's career forward only backwards ",negative

" can't really add much to the reviews. this is one of those albums that increases in listening value as it gets older. i'll admit that when this came out in '94 i only bumped the singles. it didn't grab me at the time. sometime around '97 i gave it a spin and i've been loving it ever since. there are plenty of bangers on the album but classics like pour out a little liquor str8 ballin' how long will they mourn me cradle to the grave and under pressure make this album worth owning all by themselves. the rest of the songs are on point too -- there isn't much filler on this album. the production is handled by warren g. & nate dogg (1) the awesone yet underrated easy mo b (1) johnny j (1) jay & mopreme (1) jay & syke (1) stretch (1) and thug music (4). i'd say that all contributing producers turned in dope tracks. the only tracks that i would call skip material are sh** don't stop and don't get it twisted. sh** don't stop is probably the most lazily produced track on the whole album and the lyrics are unimpressive. the production is on don't get it twisted cool but it's one of those songs that you have to be in the mood for it (in my opinion). volume 1 is a passionate if at times misdirected release from the thug life camp. the production is nothing short of vintage mid 90's cali vibes. it holds up very well 13 years after its release. of course if you're a tupac completist you probably have this album already. but even if you're not a pac fan this should be a part of your collection. r.i.p. tupac standout tracks: how long will they mourn me feat. nate dogg pour out a little liquor str8 ballin' (my favorite) cradle to the grave under pressure bury me a g feat. natasha walker (of y.n.v.)

" i don't understand the previous reviews - i found this recording positively dreadful with ruthie henshall being the only one worth listening to. john sinclair is abominable as george - he sounds like he's doing a (bad) imitation of michael crawford in &quot;hello dolly.&quot; he does strange things to his words - i guess he's trying not to sound british but why is he singing &quot;summ-ar weath-ar&quot; instead of &quot;summer weather&quot;? the ilona is a bass - almost literally. &quot;i resolve&quot; has been lowered for her and yet she still cannot master the range of the song. to accomodate her the second part of &quot;i don't know his name&quot; has a truly odd key change. were she remotely talented i could understand key changes to facilitate her singing but she's not worth it. the orchestrations are odd too with strange sleigh bell sounds appearing frequently. the rest of the singers range from fair (kodaly - a pretty voice but not much expression) to bad (mr. maraczek drags down every single note of &quot;days gone by.&quot; luckily this is his only song.) the broadway revival to my ear still has the best voices except of course that barbara cook (the original) outshines diane fratantoni who is merely good (but who was a vast improvement over the roundabout's original amalia the annoying judy kuhn.) get the original or revival recordings instead - this london version i would recommend only to die-hard she loves me fans or masochists. i'd rather sit through another terrible viewing of &quot;you've got mail&quot; than listen to this again ",negative
" the progressive metal world better wake up and take note of this outstanding band that hails from poland. these guys are a breath of fresh air with the oversaturated and stagnant progressive metal market that has developed over the past few years. so what do we get for our money you ask a band comprising of well-schooled musicians incredible song writing skills and the ability to weave so many different moods and time-passages into each song. there are a few scatterings of influences that aren't a major detraction from the overall mood of the album namely dream theater pink floyd porcupine tree genesis and anathema. the vocals are clean without a trace of an accenthowever they get getting slightly gruff in places but this only compliments the smooth flow of the music. the guitar work is outstanding and david gilmour from pink floyd is a strong reference point here. the rhythm section is outstanding; especially the drumming and the keyboards give the album a fuller sound with out being too over powering. if you want to start 2007 on a good note then riverside is a worthy investment for sure.

" the series of golden age of american rock & roll released by ace couldn't have a better end. during the past 15 years they have delighted us with a series of 10 cd's with 30 songs each remembering the rock & roll era mostly with minor top hits between 1954 and 1963. one reason for their tremendous success is the superb quality of all the recordings no matter from what year the original song was. now besides these series of 10 cd's from the r&r era they have launched another 2 special editions with the same title: one with the special novelty edition and another with the special country edition. both deserve more than 5 stars. the song selection on the novelty edition is just out of sight! most of the songs brought back memories from a long long time ago since these weren't available after the time they were top hits. i never found them back on what compilation so ever until ace put them all together 45 years later. and with a sound quality better than in their original version on 45rpm. therefore don't hesitate. buy it together with the country edition and you will have 60 songs for utmost pleasure; 60 songs we grew up with and now with no scratches on them.

" when i first heard this album i was a bit shocked. myself and my fellow tmbg fans derided it as a teen angst album moaned and whined that john & john had betrayed us by adding a band and generally refused to give it a chance. a few years later listening to my entire collection of tmbg in chonological order (a sanity-restoration ritual) i realized that this album is awesome! there are only 2 stupid songs window and dirtbike. hey for tmbg that's not bad - their fans forgive them stupidity on a regular basis. aside from that there are more rockin' thought-provoking tunes here than you'll find almost anywhere. this album establishes beyond a doubt that tmbg are among the most gifted songwriters in rock history. i'm not going to go over each individual song - there are millions of tmbg fans who have and will. i will add my 2 cents about my 4 favorites however: i should be allowed to think - tmbg does justice to beat poetry and beyond! why must i be sad? - funny and pissy great for getting those pesky emotions unstuck. the lyrics are genius subtly quoting the best of alice cooper with tongue firmly planted in cheek. a self called nowhere - righteous angry and breathtaking. angsty punk bands of the world take note: you will never be this hardcore. the end of the tour - i have written in my last wishes that i want this one played at my funeral. one of the most moving and emotionally honest rock ballads ever written. if your idea of tmbg is songs like istanbul and particle man get over it! and give this album a chance!

" ....and secured their musical legacy. the real thing was a solid rock/rap mixture with newly hired mike patton providing vocals. on angel dust patton had a lot more creative input providing his wonderful vocal stylings and schizophrenic persona to faith no more. it's a joyous ride that after a less than stellar performance initially has become something of a cult classic and favorite among many newer acts - and with good reason. this album is all over the board. land of sunshine reads like a list of fortune cookies (which is the supposed inspiration) while caffeine is an anthem for patton's drug of choice and one of fnm's most energetic recordings. then there is the occaisonal oddball track showing patton's range and sense of fun like rv which is like a melancholic rant from the stereotypical figure you might find living in an rv. not exactly bilboard material but fun. adding to the record were the internal tensions of the band. jim martin was having creative differences yet pumps out some of his best work here. tensions may have fueld a more agressive record and fnm would never sound better than they do on this album. it's the bands chemistry - both good and bad - that make this album work. commercially this might have not been the hit the record company wanted but its legacy can still be heard today and it's still a great record to crank up for a drive barely showing its 15 year old age ",positive

" while i doubt i'll ever get used to the edited (single?) version of 'nights in white satin' presented here i have to agree that the song selection in general is excellent for a compilation of this seminal band. that said the moody blues (or more likely their record label) haven't exactly been shy about releasing such anthologies and hits collections on cd either. while 'gold' represents an affordable means of buying some of the best known and loved music from the moody blues it also is for me one of the most trying listening experiences as well. if i had to guess i'd say much of the music contained on 'gold' comes from different masters than the songs currently found on other collections and on the band's original cd albums. there are definite issues with the sonic quality of these songs as presented on this disc. for instance the music track of 'nights' is horrendously compressed in comparison to earlier cd versions of this song; perhaps the record label was working with an unremastered single release master of the song (my guess) but the audible discrepancies between this version and earlier examples (albeit in the full album form including the late lament and the full orchestral intro) are hard for this listener to stomach. i can point to any of the earlier music included here and say pretty much the same thing. whatever the reason the original source material used for this cd could've seriously benefitted from earnest remastering work. while i suspect that would've raised the asking price of 'gold' i also would contend that great music deserves such caring treatment. as it is too much of 'gold' as issued is indeed quite tarnished which in the real world given the metal that goes by periodic symbol of au would've been impossible to do. but evidently in realm of the corporate music world when selling music on the cheap and banging out sloppily compiled cds it's very easy to take the most precious and thoroughly muck it up ",negative

" i appreciate bands like ima robot film school and electroclash artists for trying to add a little balance into alternative music or at least i appreciate film school for trying to merge the beauty of electronica with alternative and allow it to simmer down to the always wonderous shoegazing while bringing back the trend of the new wave you loved in the 80's. the thing about it is it is bands like these that are adding their own style into music making it worth your minutes and expanding your genres from just on band. have you heard depeche mode's albums with a wind of boards of canada? call this the album that it would have made more sense for maximo park to create if you will but this album is america's response to all other international bands showing us off hard. (the band is from san francisco i believe) and their influence for this album is a mix of electronica and 80's music (my bloody valentine. new order? depeche mode?) all leading them to create an album that doesn't quite call the band in question an american radiohead per se but with half of the music smothered in swirling guitars accompanying keyboards and a leaders effort to push the band forward a band that is trying to reach heights of originality. film school's debut (if you aren't counting their imported ep) kicks off with am intro wielding only swirls of guitar and electronics before finally bringing you into an illuminating on and on that may force your urge to name this band after interpol and elefant and a little bit of the bravery in there too but will not let you throughout this entire album. their current single pitfalls may cause them to swing on the vine of similarity since everyone is trying to bring back new wave these days but worse can happen for a band like this. the backward keyboard melody should more than make you tell the difference. the second actual interlude garrison is where boards of canada's wind starts blowing through the cd before heading back into the record that will be likely to redefine the sound of cool. if there is ever an album to chase after and count on for the safety of new wave and the health of alternative i don't see a better candidate for leg-ups than film school's latest. rating: 7.5/1 ",positive

" it's a testament to the noncomformity of the era that xtc's quirky debut album had the band initially lumped in with the late 70's first wave of british punk rock. those were different times after all. you couldn't find a teen punk these days who could make head nor tails out of the herky-jerky spastic wit of &quot;white music&quot;. come to think of it not many people could make much sense of it back then either. andy partridge's elastic vocals refused to clearly enunciate any words with more syllables than &quot;pop&quot; and barry andrews' keyboards were more an attempt to interrupt rather than complement each song. nevertheless the album worked. it rocked in its own art-damaged way and fearlessly toyed with the sacred relics of the previous generation. that lone strum of a single chord at the beginning of the fab four's &quot;hard day's night&quot; was cleverly appropriated for the intro to &quot;this is pop&quot;. a few songs later dylan's &quot;all along the watchtower&quot; got twisted into ominous goofball paranoia. there may have been more intense punk artifacts from the class of '78 but not many were anywhere near as smart as &quot;white music&quot; ",positive

" i saw midlake at festival recently and had never heard of them. the live set was strong enough to convince me to order some albums and i'm now a solid fan. the opening track roscoe reminds me a bit of adrian belew a bit of xtc and a whole lot of midlake themselves. it's like suddenly realizing how coldplay should sound. the music is layered and atmospheric with a bit of an eels feel. midlake is definitely their own band for all the influences i'm throwing out. they make the sort of music that feels old like your favorite album you lost long ago. try 'roscoe' or 'young bride' for an indication of their style. if you like either of those you need to buy the album.

" good old silly irreverent slade never really caught on in the us but their melodic early-70s glam rock sounds as energetic and fun today as it did back then and this is the best collection of their works including all of the slade's hit singles from the early '70s from 1971's &quot;get down and get with it&quot; to 1975's &quot;thanks for the memory (wham bam thank you mam)&quot;. slade scored a whopping 11 top five hits between 1971 and 1974 (five of which topped the charts) and they're all here. so are their latter-day chart entries like 1983's #2 hit &quot;my oh my&quot; but slade never got better than they did at their stomping glitter-rock peak and &quot;feel the noize&quot; captures them in all their glory filled with noddy holder and jim lea's big dumb misspelled shout-along hits (&quot;look wot you dun&quot; &quot;mama weer all crazee now&quot; &quot;skweeze me pleeze me&quot; and &quot;gudbuy t'jane&quot;) ",positive

" this is an endurance test. as in 'bitches brew''live evil''love at the fillmore' latter day miles consists of moments of brilliance combined with long stretches of absolute tedium. it makes 'jack johnson' a real non event and considering the quality of musicians on board it is a real surprise. take 'yesternow' it takes for ever for billy cobham to find a beat. this is just self indulgence of the worse kind a trait which unfortunately perpetrated a lot of the jazz fusion crossovers. miles seems to want to create 'moods' and ends up with twenty minute plus of wallpaper music. this album is the complete nadir of his jazz crossover period. mcgaughlin's guitar though breathtaking in the mahavisuna orchestra here contents himself with silly little runs totally without any structure and fire (this unfortunately was the same throughout his stay with miles) disjointed would be too kind a word. when you reliased that this was edited from long jams it makes you wonder how dull the unreleased parts were (i dread to even contemplate). miles playing though usually inspired and lyrical here struggles to solo over the fast tempo's and is embarassingly weak. maybe if i saw the film it was supposed to accompany i might view this differant but without that it is just a meandering and unfocused mess ",negative

" on an episode of seinfield that is probably overexposed enough as it is the always wily and oh so goofy character of kramer is playing a game of risk and exclaims that the ukraine is weeeeak. this causes him to get a thorough scolding and a little bit of trouble. i think the same basic sentiments work with this new order release. it probably wasn't worth the ungodly long eight year wait although it produced the excellent rock the shack and of course crystal which i'll get back to later. unlike kramer i feel i can make this statement safely as i'm not dealing with a burly alcohol swigging ukranian but new order fans which aren't the most intimidating bunch out there. keyboardist gillian gilbert is not here as she felt taking care of her kids is more important which it is maybe. this album features the guitar of billy corgan the frontman of the seminal 90's group soundgarden. too bad they couldn't get billy to collaborate five years earlier because at this point he was already full blown crazy and wasn't writing very good material or really using his guitar at all. new order also made the mistake of having corgan to backing vocals. now a synth is high pitched and shrill enough but to top that off with a billy corgan squealing like a pig cherry is probably not the best choice. so...someone like you is more or less unlistenable. it has some pretty terrible lyrics about how bernard doesn't want to wash his car. now i can relate i wouldn't want to wash my car in britain since it rains all the time and would probably be an altogether futile affair but this topic doesn't result in the most captivating and well-written material. new order occasionnally want to rawk out with guitars on this album something they don't do very often just like van morrison. now i'm not sure if i've heard a van morrison song but i've always figured it was a give that they rawk out with guitars. case in point of this `not so good of an idea rawking' is rock the shack. rock the shack kind of sounds like new order's take on someone commissioned to write an epic gilligan's island rock song pretty amazing huh? '60 miles an hour' `primitive notion' and `close range' all suffer from being a little too vanilla and a little too bland. new order have patches here where they sound like they might be suffering from the same middle-aged blandness that has crippled other 80's artist like depeche mode the cure and tears for fears (who've actually always blown). however they do succeed fully well on two songs here. there is `crystal' which is truly an excellent rock song and show new order can succeed with a harder guitar edge and is probably one of the two or three best songs of new order's career from the 90's and beyond. how this didn't get more airplay than it did is a mystery to me because it has the alternative rock of today written all over it. the other is run wild which is really a great little slow song in the vein of `as it is when it was. probably new order's only full-fledged ballad it serves as a fitting acoustic moving ending to an otherwise disappointing album. get ready is good beginning and end just not end between. kind of like that movie twin peaks: fire walk with me ",negative

" if this had been the first album in the hip-hop hits series it would not be a promising start. there are a few decent tunes on here but as someone who admired the quality of the earlier source albums i must express an intense dislike for hip hop hits vol.8. there used to be a time when the source gathered the biggest and best tracks from the rap indusrty for their compilations now benzino has turned the series into a shameless promotion for his own favorites (how else do you explain ja rule being here?). here is a song-by-song analysis of this disaster: (1) youngbloodz feat. lil jon damn c-. this song is perfect example of why people are getting bored with sothern crunk. it's lame and boring as it shows lil jon becoming a one-trick pony. not a good song to open an album with. (2) wyclef the industry b. wyclef is very talentedbut this song was never a hit. it should be heard for its quality though even if it only touchs topics breifly. it is clear that wyclef is above most of his peers in everyway; sorta like 2pac. (3) chingy right thurr b+. not my favorite rap songits better than average though it kinda grows on you. he reminds me of juvenile. it's content is not original but chingy makes it his own with a relaxed flow and style. (4) young gunz can't stop won't stop c. if this standard work is what roca-a-fella has in it's post-jay-z futurethe label is going to be in real trouble. they're good but they have to be better than good to stand on their own. (5) westside connection feat. nate dogg gangsta nation b+. it was nice to see westside together again. the style and talent cover up for the somewhat standard material. at the bare minimum the song is stylistic and very enjoyable. (6) ja-rule clap back d. this anti-eminem dis is just border line pathetic and lame. any eminem song is a bigger hit and better than ja rule's weak new stuff. if ja rule wants to return to his position pain is love brought him to he must work much harder. (7) kanye west through the wire c. kanye west has enjoyed chart success through alot of hype but i find this song to be very pedestrian for rap. the lyrics don't define kanye as an original rapper and the use chaka kahn's through the fire doesn't make a very appealing beat. (8) gang starr skills c. the group isn't that good to begin with and this song has none of the fun that militia had. gang starr has a decent hardcore sound that needs to be refined in order to define themselves. (9) j-kwon tipsy b-.this song is fun to listen to but that still does not make it any better than average. it's not really about anything and gets kinda tiresome towards the end; you may be looking at your watch. he's too overpraised. (10) e-40 feat. clipse quarterbackin c+. the track is enjoyable but was never that popular and is pretty forgetable. e-40 and clipse just aren't that talented. it almost feels as if it was made strictly for the madden football video games. (11) fabolous feat. tamia into you a. just great hip hop with style and substance. it's so nice to hear a gentler more positive hip-hop songs; one that doesn't hammer the listener but brings out emotions lightly. he is one of the best rappers of 2003; with both his album and it's singles. (12) t.i. be easy c-. he has been compared to jay-z and nelly; despite the difference that he lacks the talent those artists have. plain boring generic rap from an artist who ofers nothing new to the game; no more needs to be said. one must also wonder why this was chosen over his bigger (not exactly better though) hits rubber band man and let's get away. (13) cassidy feat. r. kelly hotel b-. a sorta fun track r. kelly does as much as possible but he even he can't make cassidy sound original. to be honest this was a huge top 10 hit though; so it kinda does belong here. (14) ying yang twins feat. lil' jon & the east side boyz salt shaker b+. surprisingly the beat and production make this song rather entertaining. it's much more fun than it has the right to be; given the non-spectacular artists involved. (15) scarface recognize c-. scarface used to be an exceptional rapper but now he's trying to regain glory that is no longer his. why listen to this when you could just buy his older albums? (16) the untouchables featuring benzino relationship with me & my gun c-.just a standard benzino track tacked on for shameless self-promotion. i wouldn't mind so much if the songt had actually been worth listening to. atleast bang ta dis on vol.5 was a good song. bottom line: *1/2. benzino has ruined the once great source series in the blink of an eye. if you want to hear a great source album buy hip hop hits vol.4; a source album with the biggest and best raps of 2000. a few good tracks are not enough to balance out all the mediocre ones. to put it in short terms: with so many good compilations out there why spend money on a bad one? i would not buy this album with a gift card.

" britain circa 1997. tony blair is elected p.m. princess di perishes. and the spice girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public. this effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing. to be fair the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is. rather they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor. the fault lies in the script that tries to do for the spice girls what a hard days' night did for the beatles. whereas the fab four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the spice craze. i was reminded more of the monkees' head than i was of a hard days' night. lots of celeb cameos (roger moore elton john et al) that amount to naught. oh well. on to from justin to kelly ",negative

" chingy is perhaps the most generic rapper in the world he is a wack lyricist and all he ever talks about is gettin pu*sy. along with several other wack commercial rappers of recent years he tarnishes the name of hip hop and because of retards like this non hip hop listeners dismiss the genre as cr*p and talentless (which is not true). jackpot went multi platinum which speaks volumes about the number of idiots who will buy anything with a tight beat. in fact the beats aren't all that bad if this was an instrumental this would actually get a higher rating as i would not have to listen to his irritating voice. if you heard right thurr in a club and thought it was tight (like i did) you are wrong chingy did not produce this album so he deserves no credit for the beats. his lyrics are absolute garbage what is sad is that a loser like this can get decent production and some top lyricists have to work with nothing. compared to this album his follow up powerballin bombed and with any luck it will be the last we ever hear from this loser. find him working at a mcdonalds near you soon!!

" the best scene in the movie is the italian restaurant scene with janeane garofalo using a wry randy quaid as her foil when she's not ignoring him. it's the only scene that made me laugh. the scene with the playboy dad having three women in his home and the one preceding it when his girlfriend's excessive dinner fails to impress the little kids are both weak. playboy dad is not interesting and that character really shouldn't have been one of the three musketeers of this movie. the other dad reiser is uncomfortable to watch. his dinner scene with his daughter is good in the sense that it shows how estranged a father can be with his teenage daughter but that too is uncomfortable to watch. the later scene up in the treehouse when his daughter suddenly loves him is completely unbelievable. the fact is that particular girl would not say those things to her dad. she doesn't love him. she doesn't need him at all. she's done with him. the stupid bit about randy quaid being a talk show star after busting into rob reiner's talk show is just dumb. that doesn't happen. if you want to write a cartoon get warner brothers to draw it for you. have the road runner in it or bugs bunny. the film gives us comfort food at the end with the trite and meaningless advice to love your kids. the fact is that your kids need love from their father when they are young but once they hit a certain age in double digits you are done. daddy just becomes the source of cash from then on. kids in their teens and twenties don't want or need anything but money from dad. fittingly i saw this film on father's day. to sum the whole movie up janeane garofalo is funny randy quaid is kind of comfortable to watch although the script gets a little stupid at the tail end and the other two male leads are just mildly annoying. the script doesn't say anything worthwhile about the subject it took on. but it takes a subject on so at least that's something. it gives exposure and food for thought on the subject of how a father fits into his family ",negative
" what they said was that katy can't rock just yet because she's a raw talent and not yet coherent in theme. i saw her live on the chicks with attitude tour with liz phair and the cardigans and charlotte martin and rose was the worst performer of the night. the first problem is that her voice just isn't that strong secondly her lyrics never come out as if they're honest and as if they are always a pretension that people feel a cool girl growing up should say. throughout her set there was only one song that stuck out as an interesting and unique thing (passingly honest as well) and that was snowflake. it's fitting that the song was preceded by an ironic intro about how she's lived in california for a long time but she hates warm weather sounds impossible but she must be truthful because it's the only song that breaks out of the leaden grunge guitar mix and hits the audience over the head with songcraft. i'm sure she has potential for the future but i think on her next album she should take a hint from beth orton who's known previous to her most recent album for being a popular artist in the realm of trip hop. stripping down your sound brings the utmost fundamentals of your idea and sound out and i think that could be helpful for her to put on record ",negative
" i first heard the song on the radio en route to work. i enjoyed it immensely and wanted to know who did the remake. no doubt's redo of the 80's hit brought back good memories of the new wave era. but of course it does not compare to the original talk talk version ",negative
" i never really noticed the soundtrack when watching this show on television but i love the show so was a little surprised when purchasing the album that all the non sound bite tracks are american country music songs. can't say i'm much of a fan of american country music so was just a bit disappointed. i think a great inclusion on this album though is the sound bites from all the leading housewife characters on this show and this alone is worth the price of the cd. was also disappointed that danny elfman's desperate housewives theme is not a separate track and ridiculously has some hidden track attached to it. the desperate housewives theme goes for 0:44 seconds then you have a break of silence for a while but still on the same track before at 1:01 a terribly sung summary of the tv show mentioning wisteria lane over and over again follows for a minute and twenty seconds. what ligic was there in not making this a separate track? you would then be able to memory it out on your stereo. i like listening to tv themes and i find this just ruins that track because you need to be near your stereo to press skip after 0:44 seconds. this cd is worth purchasing for the sound bites alone but i guess if you're just buying it for the theme song you'll have to wait for some other new tv theme compilation album to get the theme song on its own. this album also comes with an excellent cover insert booklet with lots of great pictures of characters and scenes from the show.

" i'm biased because i loved the movie and adore the book. gregson-williams does an outstanding job here (before this i was most familiar with his score work on metal gear solid videogames). the music is extremely touching and magical. the evacuating london score (from the scene in the train station) tugs at the heartstrings. and the battle score brings back the images of the dynamic battle at the movie's climax. one song that's missing is the 1940s jazz song played in the movie when the kids are playing hide and seek. other than that absence (probably due to copyright restrictions) this is an excellent cd. as for the bonus dvd - i probably wouldn't purchase it if i had a second chance. it's got some nice gallery art of movie stills and concept art. there is only one trailer and it is not the very first one released which opens with the kids at the mansion and really gets the blood pumpin' with its intro of the wardrobe. there are also behind-the-scenes interviews i haven't watched yet but i wonder if they'll appear again when the movie dvd is released.

" la bamba (1987.) the soundtrack to the ritchie valens biopic of the same name. introduction: in 1987 the film la bamba based on the life and times of fifties pop-rock star ritchie valens was released. the film cast lou diamond phillips as the classic musician and told his story from his rise to fame right down to his young and tragic death. for the film los lobos a fairly popular act of the day was asked to rerecord classic valens material for the movie. some other moderately popular musicians who portrayed other musicians of the same era depicted in the film also provided recordings for the film. so how is the soundtrack? read on and find out! overview: the la bamba soundtrack was released in 1987 around the same time as the film of the same name. contributors to the soundtrack include los lobos howard huntsberry marshall crenshaw brian setzer and bo diddley. the a-side of the soundtrack sonsists of the los lobos covers of the ritchie valens songs la bamba come on lets go ooh my head we belong together framed and donna. the b-side consists of the other artists' covers which include howard huntsberry's cover of jackie wilson's lonely teardrops marshall crenshaw's cover of buddy holly's crying waiting hoping brian setzer's cover of eddie cochran's summertime blues bo diddley's remake of his own classic tune who do you love and the two songs los lobos recorded for the film which were not remakes charlena and goodnight my love. review: awesome movie awesome soundtrack. i'm a huge fan of the music of ritchie valens and for the most part la bamba proved to be an efficient and entertaining retelling of the valens saga. aside from some omitted material (which i'll get to later) the soundtrack is every bit as good as the film it represents. read on for my reviews of the tracks. -side a- -la bamba by los lobos: los lobos covers the track that took ritchie valens to the top of the musical world. being a folk song no one ever thought a rock and roll version would do well - valens proved the non-believers wrong! los lobos does a great cover of it too. the band actually did two versions of the song for the movie - a rendition of the slower folksier version by the bar band that convinced valens to cover the song himself as well as the classic version valens did. this is the classic valens version. i wish they had included both versions of the soundtrack though (although an instrumental sequence near the end of this version does reprise elements of the folk-type version. still i wanted both versions as complete separate tracks!) -come on lets go by los lobos: this classic rockabilly-style cut was another huge hit for ritchie valens. los lobos creates a fine rendition of the classic cut staying true to the valens original while at the same time adding their own spin onto things. all in all another great song. -ooh my head by los lobos: not much to say about this one. once again los lobos manages to create an excellent version of one of the many classic valens tunes people know and love him for. every song on this soundtrack is excellent and this one is no exception. -we belong together by los lobos: ah the classic valens love song. although its success was pretty much ousted by the better known ballad donna this one was still a fairly notable hit for valens. the los lobos take on the ballad is a damn good one - but i shouldn't have to tell you that now should i? -framed by los lobos: of all of the ritchie valens song that los lobos revisited in la bamba this one is the least well known. that's a shame because it's a great song! the song takes a classic blues styling and puts a rockabilly spin on it. once again los lobos does a marvelous cover version of the song. -donna by los lobos: this song was so big a hit for ritchie valens initially that his only song even on the same plane of popularity is la bamba. the classic ode valens wrote to his high school girlfriend proved to be the stuff that has withstood the test of time. and i know you're probably getting tired of me saying this for every song but los lobos really does a good job on here. -side b- -lonely teardrops by howard huntsberry: in la bamba howard huntsberry portrayed the classic soul singer jackie wilson. and here huntsberry reprises wilson's signature tune. this is classic soul at its very best. prior to seeing la bamba i had never even heard of huntsberry. but the real shocker is that i ended up liking this version of the song more than the original! definitely a solid underrated cut. -crying waiting hoping by marshall crenshaw: marshall crenshaw a fairly popular eighties pop signer managed to land the role of buddy holly in la bamba. holly of course was killed in the same plane crash that claimed the life of ritchie valens. buddy holly is a tough guy to cover but marshall crenshaw does a damn good job of it. i personally prefer this version over holly's original (and that's saying a lot since i love buddy holly!) if you're interested in hearing crenshaw cover another holly tune check out the remastered version of his 1982 self-titled debut - he covers rave on on there as a bonus track. -summertime blues by brian setzer: long before brian setzer gained any real fame he played eddie cochran in la bamba covering the song that made that man a rockabilly legend. here's another one of those covers that is so good i like it more than the original. definitely worthwhile listening - but then again isn't every song on here? -who do you love by bo diddley: bo diddley himself did this song originally so very long ago and was asked to rerecord it for la bamba. he did and the end results are solid. diddley is a legend of the blues and this recording is just a small sample of why so many people feel that way. it just a shame that the version of this song most people remember is the george thorogood one because diddley's version is the song the way it was meant to be heard. -charlena by los lobos: in addition to the ritchie valens covers los lobos recorded two new songs for the la bamba soundtrack. this is the first of the two. essentially this here is a neo-rockabilly track of sorts and a damn good one too. long after the fifties music scene died out los lobos still managed to record a song that suited the style perfectly. -goodnight my love by los lobos: here's the second of the newly-recorded los lobos songs done for the soundtrack. what we have here is one of those classic fifties-style rock ballads that were so popular back then. if you're into that sort of thing you're going to love this song - i know i do! -other comments- omissions are the biggest problem with this soundtrack by far. as i previously stated only one version of la bamba is on here - not both versions from the film. another omission is sleepwalk the classic santo and johnny instrumental that shows up frequently in the film. its omission is likely due to the fact that it wasn't recorded just for the film but still i miss it. and then there's the issue of rip it up the classic ritchie valens rockabilly tune he first plays with his band in their garage early on in the film. this was one of my favorite songs in the film and i was devastated not to see it on here. and where's the big bopper's chantilly lace? i rated this soundtrack four stars instead of five because of omissions. if these songs had been on here it would be five stars all the way. overall: overall despite my issues with the omitted songs i am very satisfied with the la bamba soundtrack. much like the movie it's an excellent experience all the way through. if you liked the movie or you're just into this sort of music the soundtrack is well worth owning. highly recommended! edition notes: this soundtrack is becoming increasingly more difficult to find on compact disc implying it may be very gradually going out of print. take my advice - if you want it just buy it online. it's the fastest easiest way to get it.

" one of the best doobie collections out there greatest hits lives up to its name focusing on the singles the band recorded and that charted in their long career. some of the songs here are the single versions (meaning they were edited and are shorter than the album versions)and this might be a problem for some fans as they may want the full length versions of songs. maybe it's because they were trying to squeeze more music onto the cd. either way fans may want to be aware of that. in fact even on the boxed set we get listen to the music nobody and rockin' down the highway in their single incarnations. perhaps its because that was the way fans originally heard them on the radio. either way fans looking for the full length versions of these songs would do well to pick up one of the import greatest hits collections or wait for the remastered cds coming out later this year. this set does have one track not on the boxed set--without you a great rocker. the cd booklet is exactly like the larger booklet that comes with the boxed set just laid out a bit differently. this definitely covers the highlights of the band's career whether it be the tom johnston rockin' years michael mcdonald's blue-eyed soul stage or the band's reunion phase this has a bit of it all. personally i would love to see a two disc distillation of the band's greatest hits with a second disc of album tracks such as i cheat the hangman losin' end the captain and me and how do the fools survive?. in the meantime this single disc compilation will have to do for most fans. the sound is terrific pulling from the remasters produced by bill inglot for the boxed set. detail and clarity is remarkable and puts the previously issued best of pair to shame. this is the only place to get their singles from their first in 1970 nobody to their last (when this compilation was put togetherin 2001) dangerous released in 1991.

" not exactly the vaults blowing open as stated in the promo. these are mostly leftovers and one-offs from the late 1990s when the group was on hiatus from serious recording. that's why the set is overloaded with forgettable jingles from television shows literary journals and graphic design firms. whats good is the material that was recorded for albums and subsequently rejected such as reprehensible rest awhile and certain people i could name. but there are too few of these real songs and they'd have fit a lot better on that long-awaited b-sides collection from their major label career ",negative

" i love every track on ne-yo's cd in my own words! next let me thank ne-yo for bringing true r&b back to the industry! i dont consider songs about cheating on your bf/gf/husband/wife r&b. r&b is supposed to be about love - thats why people call them slow love songs. and from 2001 - 2005 new slow love songs didn't exist. i ended up listenin to the same songs from da 90's over and over until i got so tired of them and was fortunate to be lucky enough for my radio station (that plays mostly rap: a genre of music i dont like) to play so sick by ne-yo. it was a great song. this is literally the first and only r&b album that i never have the urge to use the fast forward feature to get to the next song! ne-yo's lyrics are strictly romantic and sweet too! he is a lyrical genius. his voice is soothing and melodic. most r&b albums obviously have rap tracks or rushed r&b songs as filler to probably meet the deadline or get the cd out as fast as possible and reducing the enjoyability of the cd but this album has all songs that are great. all of the tracks on this album are great but here are the ones that are superb: 1. so sick - 9/10 (would be a 10 if it wasn't played over and over and with so many different versions. although i can still listen to it over and over 2. when you're mad - 9/10 (for those guys who like the look on girls faces when they get mad. maybe for michelle rodriguez fans. :) ) 3. get down like that 10/10 (both versions) (i call it dont get down like that) (this song is for the guys that are completely faithful like me) (if you're not a player and proud of being faithful this is da song for you) 4. sexy love - 10/10 (great song. um hmmm.. what can i say about this one about its lyrics?.... oh yes.... this song is for the guys who have a girl and when she touches them it just feels like.... magic.) this is da only cd dat ever deserved 5 stars by me the only reason i gave other r&b albums 5 stars is cuz i took into consideration: there was no r&b album that existed that had nothing but good tracks and most had poorly done upbeat song ",positive

" for the longest time i have thought that observational truths were highly prone to being the most piercing of things: i have believed that the truth could either hurt (or disturb) you terribly or make you laugh so hard to the point of hysteria--or a combination of both extremes. there are many things to put this theory to the test but to cut it all short all one would need to do (if by chance it hasn't been done already) is experience the observational humor of richard pryor to possibly get a better understanding of what i am talking about. this classic comedy album from 1975 is a prime example. richard pryor has been hailed as a genius by many and i would have to agree: it takes plenty of intelligence and natural talent to be a comedian for starters but to also turn many disturbing observational truths of everyday life into something painfully body-breakingly hilarious takes a whole lot of something as well. from the very beginning to the tail-end of this cd 1975's _is it something i said?_ is a non-stop laugh fest that personally gets *me* laughing so loud and hard i end up pretty much abusing almost every part of my body in the process: my throat my lungs my sides my stomach--they all end up feeling beaten and worn-out. richard's takes on drugs sex race & racism relationships and politics in general are every bit as painfully observational as they are profane--and did i mention hilarious? the racy quality of the material found here makes so much of what's referred to as cutting-edge these days seem so contrived and unaffecting; richard's observations seem just as relevant now--if not more so--as they were 30 years ago. i couldn't be graphic in pointing out some of the sickeningly funny moments on this disc -- and there are many -- but i should say that the opening one-two punch of eulogy and shortage of white people and richard's take on his own battle with cocaine addiction in the cocaine bit get me cracking up so hysterically i sometimes need to be careful not to make myself sick. and again those are just a few of the many hysterical blasts found here. richard pryor is considered a comedic legend for a reason. this album here is a good example as to why he is considered as such. just don't play it for the kids and for the love of god *don't* play it during the middle of the night; you most certainly will disturb the beauty rest of your family and your neighbors. and you know what could happen if you disturb one person's beauty rest: just imagine what would happen if you disturbed the beauty rest of many..

" this is the best cover album i have ever seen or heard in my life. a wonderful selection of material and a reflection of agnetha's great judgment of how best to pay tribute to her favorite and most influential musical artists. her voice is absolutely flawless and just as powerful (and pure) as her days of old with abba. it would have sold well with the right kind of promotion such as touring which i read she had planned at one point. unfortunately she had to cancel any such ideas. i would travel anywhere in the world to see her live just once in my life whether it be to listen to any of the catchy tunes from this album or anything previous. we can only hope the day will come that she will do a live show again for us adoring and anxious fans. it's certainly not out of the realm of possibility. it is neither an impossibility that agnetha record subsequent material in the not too distant future as this album without a doubt indicates she has so much great music left in her soul to share with the world ",positive
" i would say that this is the closest that cheap trick ever got to making a perfect album. there are only two songs on here that i'm not one hundred percent crazy about...the slow and gloomy depressing title track and ' on the radio ' which i think kisses up to radio d.j.'s too much. i love the rest of this. this album was my introduction to cheap trick and i would definitely recommend it to anybody as introduction to them. ' surrender ' is an out and out classic and possibly my favorite cheap trick song of all time. like most of the rest of the album it's heavy it's catchy has great singing and interesting lyrics and it says all it has to say in three to five minutes. ' auf weidersehen ' is another favorite tune of mine...it may be one of the heaviest tunes c.t. has ever done. i particularly love bun e.'s energetic drumming on it. zander really rips his vocal chords to shreads on this tune! another great hard rocker is 'stiff competition'. of the more pop oriented songs i would say ' taking me back ' is another personal favorite of mine. probably should have been a hit dang it! ' how are you ' shows off the band's terrific sense of humor...i particularly like the reference to one of their earlier songs! the other tunes from the first half that i didn't mention are also terrific particularly ' on top of the world '. my only complaint about this newly remastered version is that it doesn't include the lyrics which were included on the original lp version. that is but a minor complaint. i don't think cheap trick ever made another album quite as great as this one.

" eric reed is a monster pianist. under the right circumstances he could record a christmas album that would become an instant classic. this however is an unfortunate example of what happens when an overconfident artist tries to do everything himself. reed produced and arranged this album himself. probably if he had hired an objective producer that producer would have told him to hire an arranger. reed's arrangements are second-rate. his version of santa claus is coming to town has been downshifted into a parody that serves as the worst example of an annoying trend: reed attempts to put a fresh twist on nearly every song. it's an admirable goal but he doesn't have what it takes; and the result is like a restaurant that serves hamburgers with a knife and fork and swordfish crumbled over salad. it just doesn't work. i hope this isn't the last christmas album from eric reed. he's one of the truly original voices of his generation; and with his gospel background and feel for the blues there's no doubt in my mind he could record an album that would rival a charlie brown christmas. but this isn't it. he needs to hand over the reins of his next project and focus on the piano ",negative

" i won't go into a long diatribe. suffice it to say that when i listened to this upon its release earlier this year i was disappointed. i gave it a few more close listens and find that the musical quality is not great. this is more a photo of dylan as a free-spirit. there's a point where baez messes up a song. (i don't have anything against baez. that being said i don't have much for her either.) there's joking and laughing but really i don't need a double-disk of acoustic material that seems to be performed by someone who sounds like he'd rather be in the audience than performing. you can almost sense why dylan went electric in this concert. the bootlegs prior to this are superior and i would suggest that if you aren't a die-hard dylan fan to stick with them. if you really like dylan's acoustic work and not his electric stuff you should be pleased with this double-disc. i love dylan but not enough to enjoy this over and over again. i'll go to disk one of the 4th bootleg for my acoustic fix ",negative
" when i first saw this album i thought heavy d....without the boyz?! that can't be a good thing. here's the problem with this album: heavy d took the jiggy route. when i heard big daddy for the first time i thought it was pretty tight and that it had that heavy d feel to it. so after hearing that i went and copped the disc. when i got home and read the liner notes my jaw hit the floor. there was heavy d....smoking cigars iced out and playing the big willie role (the popular theme for the jiggy crowd in '97). at that point i realized that original mcs were quickly becoming extinct. after years of success with his group heavy d had jumped the fence while simultaneously alienating his fan base all at the same time. that might not have been such a bad thing had this album been at least somewhat decent. there are about three tracks on the entire album that are even worth a listen. there's a lot of lazy and predictable production (we're talking obscene amounts of beat jacking). on i'll do anything heavy d and tony dofat completely jacked hall & oates for their tune i can't go for that (no can do) and it only gets worse throughout the album (i won't even get into how the gap band's yearnin' for your love was abused on keep it comin'). there aren't enough good songs on this album to make heavy's change of heart seem very believable. avoid this album y'all. it's not completely terrible but it comes dangerously close. there are songs that border on wack and there are songs that are completely wack. sadly enough this can be said for the majority of the songs on this album. i was very disappointed in heavy d and lost a little respect for him after hearing this. i can only reccomend buying this if you can find it used for less than $3.00. otherwise avoid at all costs. standout tracks: big daddy (my favorite) and you can get it feat. the lost boyz & soul for rea ",negative

" the dictators are incredible. few bands can alternativly spoof and embrace the rock 'n' roll ideals as these guys have and their spinal-tap-meets-ramones-mees-beach-boys style almost always works - almost. manifest destiny is a dissapointing release from the 'tators. i mean its not a bad album but the guys can do much better than this. there are a few good songs. disease is hilarious particulary the spoken word act from handsome dick at the begining. science gone too far is one of the band's catchiest tunes proving they were as good as any of the big names from the 60s. their closing cover of the stooges' search & destroy is an okay interperatation of the classic. however that's about it. the rest are mostly humorless fm-style rockers and while the dictators weren't selling out they were certainly trying to become more accesible. download those three tunes and pick up every other album by the band ",negative
" which i suppose i'm not allowed to say what with the worldwide phenomenon that was songs from the big chair. but i think it's right. roland took the opportunity following the breakup with curt to make an aggressively postmodern record and return to the steely-eyed austerity that the lyrics on the hurting always suggested. indeed this album is continually proving to be ahead of its time; as a previous reviewer noted goodnight song has what has since become a familiar aor sound. i call it the first coldplay song and it's fair to suggest that band would never exist without tears for fears. roland also finally nails the pacing of an album here. on songs and seeds 8 tracks was not enough to allow for a full dynamic arc a sense of opening progression and completion; the 10 songs here have room to breathe vary significantly between each other and finally close satisfyingly with goodnight. as both roland and curt have matured they have also mellowed. the anger they felt at the world and towards each other seems to be gone. and their latest album everybody loves a happy ending has none of the dge that made their older stuff so energizing. but cds don't age so pick this sucker up. it really doesn't get much better ",positive
" i like jennifer lopez but i am not a fan of j.lo...let me explain. jennifer started her career in the mid 90s did some promising work (selena / out of sight / the cell / blood and wine / etc.) and a very well done debut album for an actor (on the 6). everything was genuinely promising. unfortunately once j.lo was born (circa 2001) her endeavours got weak too commercial for the sake of money too fixed only to hype her up not all that original nor different than anyone else to truly stand out. rebirth is an example of that. when i heard get right for the first time i loved it i thought it was catchy. it harkened the days of on the 6..that sassy groovy r-n-b vibe she had. then i caught step into my world the only real r-n-b track on the album and thought i'm feelin' it definitely a favorite to this day. the the rest came along (3-11) and i thought sony & j.lo made this for the sake of money due to her films doing poorly hence she had time off to commit to recording a new album. i thought it was a very obviously fake attempt to compensate. i think she is a great performer a very talented person but i honestly don't feel this album makes her an artist merely a reworking of herself musically. i rank it 3rd in her album line... on the 6 (4 stars) j.lo (3 stars) rebirth (2 stars) this is me...then (2 stars) ",negative

" tunisian anouar brahem's le voyage de sahar finds him in the same company- pianist francis courturier and accordionist jean-louis martinier- as 2002's highly acclaimed le pas du chat noir. having toured in support of that cd the trio developed into a true group something that brahem accentuates to great effect on this program of new compositions and three favorites that are recast with the new ensemble. with voyage brahem continues a trend of creating music that is not as overtly jazzy as some of his earlier outings. nonetheless he remains a master a crafting deliciously vivid richly evocative compositions that distill arabic music and european jazz sensibilities with a warm sonorous chamber music vibe. among the ports of call on this voyage are zarabanda whose elegant lope recalls the french riviera. elsewhere the title track exudes mysticism tempered with intrigue while cordoba and ete andalous are meditative pieces with a decidedly cinematic scope. the gentle bounce of nuba and introspection of les jardins de ziryab both include uncredited but effective passages of voice. rarely do you hear music this gorgeous ",positive
" diana krall's popularity is not hard to understand she's easy on the eyes and possesses a fine voice - rich round and polished. but that's where the good news ends. the selection of material and the narcoleptic bossa-nova-on-the-rocks arrangements combine to create a cd that is nothing less than a love song to darvon in fact inside industry sources maintain that the entire cd was recorded in the frozen food section of a supermarket late at night in order to eliminate the middle man. the rule with standards is don't do them unless you can bring something fresh to the fair. ms. krall beats these exhausted warhorses mercilessly; cruel and unusual punishment considering it's a wonder they're still standing. the resuscitation of popsicle toes is both the final insult and injury for blissful years this sliver of saccharine twaddle resided in richly deserved obscurity; how could she do this to us? wherever there are hotel lobbies occupied by mildly inebriated people who aren't listening to each other much less the ambient audio wallpaper there will be a demand for music of this type. the diana kralls of the world can always find work because for many - smooth equals good. walk don't krall. beyond this woozy soft-focused world there is music that is real and really matters.

" darren aronofsky's movies are beautiful masterpieces. from pi to the fountain going through requiem for a dream they will forever stand as timeless jewels. so they are hard to top in any way but clint mansell has been able to do it every single time scoring each of them. for the fountain he teamed up once more with kronos quartet and had scottish post-rock band mogwai join in too to produce a score that fits the movie like a glove in a very organic way. the central theme to the movie is instrumented in a way that works fantastically well across all the time periods the movie encompasses. the combination of the talents of mansell the quartet and mogwai yields a relatively dark yet breathtaking musical piece that will stand the test of time much like the movie it was meant to score ",positive

" robin gibb has one of the most distinctive voices of the 1960s. with the bee gees or as a solo artist he has enough hits to make his own live show. however in this live recording he chooses to recreate mostly bee gees hits on which he had a secondary role on their famous three part harmonies. thus he needs the help of another lead singer chorus and the neue philharmonie frankfurt orchestra. but everything goes wrong here: robin's voice remains buried among a real bulk of unmixed music; the lead singer (no list of credits) is a poor substitute to barry gibb's famous falsetto; the female voices are not very inspired to say the least; while the orchestra is frequently out of tune and noisy (the winds on juliet are really unbearable). post-production seems to be non-existent and the overall sound is chaotic. lines notes by experts andrew mon hughes and ann grootjans are interesting and illustrative but they seem to belong to another album. the message from robin gibb seems to be clear: i can do it all by myself. well he cannot. he should re listen to one night only (1998) and check for sound harmonies and production ",negative

" this is my all time favourite jacksons album. this album along with `mama can't buy you love' and anything by donna summer were hogging the airwaves during my first visit to the states as a kid. comprising mainly jackson compositions (and production) it showed a more mature and funky side of the group and was far more consistent than their hit filled but patchy motown works. filled with their trademark smooth harmonies lots of horns and michael's distinctive vocals the album hit #11 on the billboard album charts (#3 r&b) was certified platinum and had a smash hit single in `shake your body (down to the ground)' #7 pop. `blame it on the boogie' opened the album in style a funky upbeat disco tune that one couldn't keep still while it played. other dancefloor anthems are the horn laden `things i do for you' the frenetic `all night dancin'' and the shimmery `shake your body' with its distinctive riff which hinted at future mj songs like `don't stop till you get enough' and `workin' day and night'. for me however the songs that really did it for me were the ballads. `push me away' is a lush sun kissed ballad featuring a passionate vocal delivery from michael alternating from full voice to falsetto with ease. great horns! title track `destiny' has an acoustic guitar intro which leads into an amazing ballad where michael declares `if it's the rich life i don't want it/happiness aint always material things'. great backing harmonies too. `bless his soul' is simply stunning! featuring pensive lyrics about trying to do what's right but never seeming to please anyone. `you just can't please the world and yourself' sings jackie. this song starts off tender with congas fleeting horns and strings which after the second chorus builds to a superb climax of `the life you're living is dangerous' and a fab outro of `hey ha ha ha'. then comes the final track and my favourite. the dramatic `that's what you get for being polite'. a thumping piano leads to horns and sweeping strings and then michael tells us the sad tale of some lonely guy named jack who wants to be what he is not and would do anything for love. dazzling instrumentation a stellar vocal performance from michael the cover art was a painting depicting the group with their huge afros and the original vinyl release folded open like a book with individual shots of the brothers. one of my favourite childhood albums one of my all time favourite albums and a classic!

" i can't even begin to say how much i love these albums (i just picked uyi 1 to write my review for both). everyone always says that appetite is guns best album...no way in hell. the illusion albums are so much richer. now don't get me wrong i love appetite but it is more of a party album with cool guitar work and catchy tunes. the illusion twins are just so much deeper lyrically and have many more styles woven in and out of a hard rock framework. i can identify with so many of axls lyrics and the music just makes them stand out so much more. slash is basically the best hard rock guitar player ever and he has more awesome solos and leads on these albums than most guitar players have in a career. and the best part about these albums is that the lesser known songs are usually the best such as: locomotive bad apples dont damn me the garden pretty tied up coma civil war get in the ring breakdown estranged (kind of popular but still fairly unknown) 14 years bad obscession dust n bones dead horse and more. then of course there are the hits dont cry november rain knockin on heavens door live and let die you could be mine etc. the only songs i dont really like that much are my world (wtf?) and shotgun blues but everything else is just so gdamn good. do yourself a favor and go buy these albums if u consider yourself a hard rock fan. the illusion albums are art plain and simple ",positive
" michael jackson is one of the most gifted songwriters/singers of our time. you can discuss his person you can discuss his behaviour and all the other stuff but you can't really take that away from him. and that's exactly why this album is so unacceptable coming from someone like him - when you've reached superstardom and gone beyond it you don't release a record that's so horribly mixed up and full of second grade tracks that it's bound to be a faliure. at least you should expect to hear for it. and hear for it he did cause the critics didn't go lightly on this one. and it's not that bad actually. i mean that's what i have my program function in my cd-player for and my cd-burner. the album starts on a fair streak - unbreakable heartbreaker and invincible - are all fair tracks - below average for mj sounds like a watered down selection of discarded tracks from dangerous that were then discarded for history and then discarded for blood on the dance floor and full of badly placed guest rappers to top it off - but apart from that if you forget who made this music these are actually good funky dance tracks. for michael jackson they're passable but nothing more. *skip* on to track 8 - speechless - arguably the strongest moment on the record. one of only two tracks that jackson actually penned himself and it shows. the amount of emotion in his voice will knock you prone and actually proves very well what the rest of the album lacks: joy for the music and personal emotion. the lyrics are like a poem and one of the most beautiful love declarations in all their simplicity. top grade to jackson for this one track and if you are into his music buy the cd cheeply just to get this track. track 9 - 2000 watts - is another of the stronger moments of the record. this one is simply plain fun and that's another important lesson jackson should have lurned - to let go of the reigns and stop caring whether it's hip or street or down with the trend - because it isn't - but this is darn good pop music and nigh irresistable. *skip* on to track 13 - cry - penned by r. kelley. the same r. kelley who is guilty of writing one of the most horrible songs of all times (i believe i can fly if you had doubts) but it seems that with jackson he can do no wrong. he wrote the endearing you are not alone - major hit in europe - and this track is possibly even better. oh forget about the sappy lyrics and just enjoy the wonderfull music. this is pop writing in top class and if jackson sounds like he takes the marthyr role a bit too seriously it's still one of the best tracks on the record. track 14 - the lost children - is the other song penned by michael alone and it's not a bad effort - had it not been for the children choir and sleezy intro you could probably have ignored the lyrics and enjoyed a nice pop tune. as it is it falls somewhat flat and becomes completely choking in the end - but yes it's a nice tune. thumps up mr. jackson. track 15 - whatever happens. ok that's one weird track. michael jackson featuring santane. wtf? well kudos for doing this and it actually works in a sort of absurd way. not single potential and not a classic but it's not embarassing and as an album filler it's completely acceptable as a cureosity. well what about the rest of it then? lead single you rock my world was never my favorite - the spoken intro is downright embarassing - but the track is not bad. i can accept that on the record. the same is not true for the horrible ballads break of dawn heaven can wait butterflies you are my life and don't walk away. one is worse than the next and every time i just try to listen to them i start chocking to the degree of loosing my last meal. yes it's that bad no really it's horrible. i. can't. stand. these. songs. period. there are simply no redeeming qualities for me. and then the two monstrosities - privacy and threatened - that just sound like a very - very - bad joke on the man himself. tabloid junkie from history actually worked because it packed a great punch and well had not been heart before. well it had been it was pretty much the same as why you wanna trip on me from dangerous but still. it worked. ghosts was a good track of blood on the dance floor. forget about the movie that was - well embarassing. but the music was good. these tracks aren't. they sound dated repetitive out of place and utterly boring and uninspired. get over it jackson we don't want to hear more about the media nagging you it's not going to make them go away. well all in all what do we have ... to take the album from a to z: unbreakable - 6/10 - a fair dance track. heartbreaker - 6/10 - same. invincible - 6/10 - same. break of dawn - 0/10 - horrible r'n'b overproduced. vomit. heaven can wait - 0/10 - same. you rock my world - 5/10 - well at least it sounds new. butterflies - 0/10 - more vomit. speechless - 10/10 - the flower in the dirt. one true mj song. 2000 watts - 8/10 - very enjoyable and stands out tall compared to the rest. you are my life - 0/10 - even more vomit. privacy - 2/10 - yawn. repetitive and dated. don't walk away - 0/10 - end of vomit. cry - 9/10 - beautiful showmanship kelly + jackson works - again. the lost children - 6/10 - well it has potential. whatever happens - 7/10 - interesting and well refreshing if somewhat strange. threatened - 2/10 - same as privacy and exactly as boring. this yields and average about 3.6/10 or 2/5 stars which actually matches my fealings for this album fairly well. yes i'm harsh but from a man as gifted as jackson you just expect more. quality control next time please mr. jackson. on the bottom line: outtakes the way you love me and we've had enough showed up on the 2004 ultimate collection and outranked 2/3 of this album by far. go figure ",negative
" if you want the original recordings don't purchase any volume of television's greatest hits. i've had better luck recording the songs off of my tv with a cassette tape recorder and then dehissing them on my pc. these collections have sterile sounding fake stereo recordings of the beverly hillbillies and the munsters that just don't sound right to me. if the original recordings don't matter to you then you may like this cd ",negative
" pablo is definitely the babe ruth/moses of these pieces. however tempo cadence clarity consistency and emotional projection are much better here. starker is at least the michael jordan of the bach suites. -and compared to pablo (i heard the naxos one) the sound quality on this disc is the right hand of god. starker is the dog's balls; big ones like a great dane.

" when i bought this cd i did not know that much about supergrass. the only songs i had even heard were pumping on the stereo and sun hits the sky and i liked both of these songs a lot. so while i was cruising the aisles in the record shop my eyes caught a glimpse of supergrass is 10 so i decided to buy it because it was at a great price and i am glad i did. the cd has not left my car since i bought it two months ago. every single one of the songs can get stuck in your head and you won'tbe upset. from the opening track caught by the fuzz to the finale wait for the sun the album just rock throughout and everytime i listen to it i want more. the album clocks in at 71 minutes but everytime i am done listenintg to it i feel unfulfilled. that is a sign of a band making great music ",positive
" i bought this album because i loved the title song. it's such a great song how bad can the rest of the album be right? well the rest of the songs are just filler and aren't worth the money i paid for this. it's either shameless bubblegum or oversentimentalized depressing tripe. kenny chesney is a popular artist and as a result he is in the cookie cutter category of the nashville music scene. he's gotta pump out the albums so the record company can keep lining their pockets while the suckers out there keep buying this garbage to perpetuate more garbage coming out of that town. i'll get down off my soapbox now. but country music really needs to get back to it's roots and stop this pop nonsense. what country music really is and what it is considered to be by mainstream are two different things.

" i have been hankering after this great album on cd for a long time now. imagine my surprise to suddenly find out that it is available. surprise turned to shock when i saw the price. does the company that produces this cd not realise that are people all around the world (including south africa where i live) who are very keen on this album? at this stage though it is only the very wealthy that can afford it.

" considered one of coltrane's 'searching' periods this cd has a lot to offer in the way of understanding trane's restless nature. never one to stand on laurels coltrane does indeed continue to set the bar 'higher' every time out. this one is mostly ballad and blues based with the exeption of 2 tracks in particular which stand out - on both ends of the trane spectrum. track #2 i love you finds him playing furious cerebral runs on the instrument and frankly not as 'listenable' as one may like; whereas the track with donald byrd is as 'in the pocket' as you'll ever hear. all in all a very realistic look at a genius in motion ",positive
" i really enjoyed the song kids in america by no secrets. both of my children enjoyed it as well. in fact i have been looking for their cd or for more information on them. i thought they were cute fresh and brought a new touch to the song ",positive
" this is what music is all about the emotion in a simple legato trumpet note or the raspy delicious vibrato of vocalist david sylvian; it makes me melt and feel so good and pure. think if tweaker were to make jazz--and really chill out--this is what it would sound like. you'll never hear a sweeter sounding clarinet ever. there is everything one could want. possibly the perfect record. it's jazzy and cinematic and the double bass throughout is enough to make anyone melt and feel the emotion of the music course through their soul. absolutely brilliant and definitely essential. one of my favorites from the year.

" julieta venegas did it again. she scored an album that is not alternative in style however it is very catchy pop music. her melodies are perfect for a morning drive with the radio on. you can sing along and express day to day feelings. julieta continues to use instruments i like such as the harmonica. and of course julietas nice character and her lovely behavior shine through in her public appearances. my personal favorite is me voy a very positive song about a not so positive event breaking-up. keep up the good work julieta. your songs are appreciated.

" buyer beware. these new journey releases are reissues of their 1996 remastered releases. they are not remastered in 2006. rhino should be ashamed of itself for this (it's been 10 years - i would have gladly paid for a remastered version but not for new packaging) ",negative
" well i'll explain that later. she uses her own vocals. she doesn't even have the balls to let the artists who rework the song use their own vocals.i love how the editoral review uses the term unique vocal talent. yoko has no vocal talents. i must also point out i am courtney love's number one fan so this should give me even more cred. it just proves how narcissistic and disgusting yoko is that she won't let other artists do an album using their own vox. she loves the sound of her own too much! i already went through that stage where i made everyone listen her as a joke. i was about 14 then. my point here this isn't even a good joke. its just dumb. i listened to the song clips provided on amazon. even that was too much. if you must just download this album for free. do not buy it. do not in any way support this woman. i wish there was a zero star rating.

" yo gotti in the past can spit some raw ish but on this one i dunno what happpened.....the production seemed too generic the rapping was pretty average and generic and not that impressive at all and doesnt carry much replay value....to be honest id pop in a three 6 mafia cd rather than this one....album was slacking on so many levels now theres some tracks that listenable but the rest make it hard to enjoy this album nothin special bout it at all...this album waz overhyped i believe and flopped horribly.......gotti can do much better than this.....wouldnt recommend anyone to chek it out..... 2.5/ ",negative
" he was at his best when he sang about the loneliness perseverance and dreams of ordinary people. in sandra for instance it felt like he was singing about a neighbour. the combination of his warm voice with his piano could be very moving and was definitely unique. in the late eighties he started focusing on merely performing and doing cover versions. he released a few inspired tracks now and then his first christmas album had a lot of charisma and warmth and here at the mayflower was a sincere effort. he is an intelligent person who cares for music and doesn't let his superstardom go to his head. so what has changed? and why this late in his career? barry has reinvented himself as a las vegas entertainer liberace style. and he's released an album with unchallenging versions of evergreens. i have no doubt that he genuinely wants to make people happy like liberace did. and i have deep respect for that. but i personally regret that clive davis and manilow have now decided to manufacture products for a larger audience - one that doesn't really have any demands.

" i do not own this cd but i recently saw the doctor at a local jazz club and was blown away. he had a good sense of humor and was very worldly. he would ascend and spiral upwords untill every one in the club's heart rate had spead up 100 notches... and boom... he was back to being relaxed old lonnie. at the break i met him and got an autograph. he was very insightful musical and with spoken words.i would reccomend seeing him live aswell as buying his album ",positive
" this album is ridiculous. i almost want to say part of srv's soul is in this guy...he is that good. honestly i think this album rips apart his previous two. my hope is that jimmy dt and apo will bring out a 4th release...as good as this album or better! this is one of those great albums where every song is good. buy it. you like srv buy it. double trouble must have brought part of srv back because this album is just plain sweet ",positive
" in 1976 my fair lady returned to broadway in a revival touted as the 20th anniversary production. perhaps most famously this particular revival was the first big professional splash of a young soprano called christine andreas... at long last this much sought-after cast album gets its cd premiere. christine andreas is one of the best eliza's ever captured on disc and ian richardson's performance as beleaguered tutor higgins is full of wit and humour. george rose (in a tony-winning turn as eliza's dustman father) is very enjoyable in his main numbers with a little bit of luck and get me to the church on time. jerry lanning also makes for a fine freddy with the winsome on the street where you live. this recording also features the embassy waltz sequence which was never included on the obc and only featured as a bonus track on the reissue of the olc. the production itself heavily recreated the original production complete with oliver smith's sets and cecil beaton's costumes. hanya holm's choreography was revived thanks to original dance captain crandall diehl. christine andreas picked up a theatre world award for her breakthrough performance. the show opened at the st. james theatre on march 25th 1976 but later moved to the lunt-fontanne theatre where it closed the following year after 377 performances. the following year andreas returned to broadway in another important revival the 1978 production of oklahoma! in which she made a thrilling laurey (cast album available on rca); before cememting her position as broadway's ingenue of choice with the role of frankie frayne in the 1983 revival of on your toes (cast album available on jay/ter). more recently she played marguerite st. just in the original company of frank wildhorn's flawed scarlet pimpernel (cast album available on atlantic). i heartily recommend this particular my fair lady ",positive

" if this album didn't come out at its destinated time 2006 would have been one of the worst years for gospel music. outside of kurt carr's cd this album makes singing gospel music worthwhile. donald lawrence knows how to send out a group and bring in a new era of singers. that's basically what this finale does it brings into the forefront the future of the gospel music scene. we have new artists emerging in blanche (mcalister-not sure if she is going to just do the first name like madonna cher mandisa ummmmm think about it!!!!!!!!) dewayne woods (thanks for the testimony and great sunday morning rocking song - this is hint to all church musicians sing this song when church is a lil dead and pick it up) the murrills lajeune thompson (sang girl) and sheri from the duo of ted & sheri. there are so many hits on the whole cd from god is god you are an heir giants blessing from abraham encourage yourself of course all of the older stuff. one thing missing is kelly price should have guested on i walk with god or bring back stephanie mills.

" this cd reminds me once again why russian liturgical music is one of the treasures of the world: beautiful profound awe-inspiring uplifting. for the most part the pieces are well chosen and the performances excellent. i am delighted to see that many of the tracks are from the classic recording of the rachmaninoff vespers made in the early 1970s by the ussr ministry of culture chamber choir directed by valery polyansky and released in the usa by angel-melodiya. i wore out my copy of the lp years ago; although it has been reissued on cd it's out of print and very hard to find. so it is wonderful to see a generous selection from that recording available on this disk. listen to track 11 praise the lord o my soul sung by the chamber choir and mezzo irina arkhipova. you would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved as she sings slava ghospidin (praise to the lord). and listen to how the basses descend to b-flat at end. it just doesn't get any better than this ",positive

" i'm sorry to vent on the stylistics certainly others are guilty of this but $33 to get all the stylistics hits is way too expensive. sorry love the stylistics and the spinners too (whose double cd anthology is around $30 too). why is something like lionel richie and the commodores 2cd gold $13.99? oh well... i'll wait ",negative
" at the end of the day when you come home from school or work one can't say &quot;i feel great.&quot; rather than great we are stressed and tired. the sounds of falling rain is evermore relaxing that this cd captures it it almost perfectly. i too am always stressed at the end of a work day and have relaxed to the sound of falling rain; and it does work. it would also be helpful to listen to while sleeping. with quiet natural sounds it will have a soporific effect on its listeners and relax you ",positive
" brilliant glorious music--all of it although i agree with those who have come to feel that the ellington/strayhorn version of &quot;the nutcracker suite&quot; in particular is an all-too-often-buried treasure that no christmas season should be without (and if you can ignore it for the rest of the year you have more willpower than i). what happens to tchaikovsky's marvellous music--and grieg's too--in these hands is creative homage of the highest order: the music is re-imagined from the inside in wholly jazz terms in a way that simultaneously illuminates and completely reconceives the original. what balanchine did for tchaikovsky and stravinsky in dance ellington here does for tchaikovsky and grieg in another realm of music and leaves us with works that deserve to be every bit as loved and celebrated as their older and better-known prototypes. and to top it all off you get ellington and strayhorn's own superb &quot;suite thursday.&quot; listen and rejoice ",positive
" the clean kick-started the illustrious new zealand label flying nun in 1981 providing a key blueprint for indie-rockers from australia (the chills) to california (pavement). over this two-disc 46-track set of rarities and essentials the trio takes the chugga-chugga racket of the velvet underground and stretches it into an entire garage aesthetic of excited rudimentary playing shaky kiwi-accented vocals and endearing melodies. disc one as influential for the lo-fi sonics as for the songs ends with the clean's 1983 breakup. disc two spans their 1988 reunion and 1996's unknown country mining similar material with even more exciting (and even better-sounding) results. but by then lots of bands were doing what the mighty clean had helped pioneer.

" following 2002's self-produced and underrated under rug swept morissette returns in 2004 with so-called chaos. with this release morissette has done a complete makeover of her look with a serious haircut and sporting a look of casual glamour like she's aspiring to take hollywood by strom but isn't 100% sure. maybe the new look and image might have worked if morissette's makeover in sound was good enough to go with it-but it's not. this cd starts out good with the opening cut eight easy steps a fast-paced rockin' tune with alanis at the wheel of leadership but also ready to bust her own chops at the same moment. out is through follows and also stands out but then so-called chaos begins to turn problematic by not having an edge. and morissette should never have brought john shanks or tim thorney(or both)on board for assistance because she was left with bland arrangements behind many of the tracks. doth i protest too much is without a doubt the worst song alanis has ever recorded. the title song attempts for a gritty and gutsy feel but even that attempt becomes overshadowed by morissette's lyrics(yes not her best work)when she refers to heartburn headaches and breached contracts as primary results of a chaotic lifestyle. the tracks continue with all of me and this grudge both rather dull while the closing track everything was a weak choice for the first single. morissette has always been a progressive artist but so-called chaos doesn't measure up to any of its predecessors and may leave many fans longing to see the girl with the jagged heart still spinning with her free-flowing locks firmly in place.
