 oh! boy! how things have change..years ago i invested thousands of dollars in a killer dvd-audio/super-audio multichannel surround system.this was done to capture the glory of the state of the art music mastered in the wide frequency response of 24/192khz.example ..donald fagen morph the cat dvd-audio disc..this dics captures the dedicated genuine glory of dvd-audio multichannel done superbly.today we have the so call bonus dvd audio disc packaged together for one low rediculous price only to be disappointed with the amature quality of the 5.1 mix.if you are an audiophile like me and know the difference between the dedicated dvd-audio disc sold between $14.99-$29.99 and the so call bonus dvd disc...you will understand why iam so irritated at this new phenomenon.today most good recievers can play back stereo recorded music in all channel stereo/multichannel stereo surround which sounds superior to the so call dvd 5.1 disc.the stereo version of the beatles love album is worthy of my expensive system and is highly recommended ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 if you need an experience of pure meaningless noise this one's for you. however dont expect it to change your life much. the price listed above for the album is a very good example of the old cliche you get what you pay for. ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative

 this era of tangerine dream (td) was just great. the virgin years were truly a great period for td. for me it deals with space and landscape. it's so close to repetitive music that would come much later. it's also the one group that used rythm to structure these flying melodies. you could fly with them and end up with more in the end. you can't say that for too many of these electronic groups. after that period they would go on with this ambient music that wasn't up to the same standards. it seems they are back (with other musicians of course) with the same kind of concept. great! they were an important link on the electronic scene. a great album! a great period ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative

 i owned this as an lp and played it over and over on my tiny mono phonograph. i loved it then and i love it now. rainmaker i'm on my way back home and love is all that i ever needed would all have been sucessful singles. i would have loved you anyway is the only song i don't really like but the lyrics are unintentionally funny. all the lyrics seem more suggestive now than they did then but that's ok! the background singers get a tad tiring but go david cassidy! i don't care if it's the memories or not i enjoy putting this on and turning it up ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative

 while the sound of the stream is relaxing and well recorded there are way too many birds around. the cd describes their sound as distant and faint but that's far from accurate. the parts of the cd where all you hear is the stream alone don't add up to more than 10 minutes and never last more than a minute. for the most part you will hear the stream and plenty of birds rather close and sometimes very loud. buyer beware: the 30 second samples you get here are precisely from the parts with no birds at all! very misleading ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative
 even as dedicated of a radiohead fan as i am i really don't care much for this album. i say thank goodness for creep because we may have never heard from them again (or at least not in the same way) if that song had not become as popular as it did ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 i've always seen sheryl crow as a middle-of-the-road rock artist. my wife and i got a couple of her disc's plus that very best of cd and was really looking forward to her latest but this one...zzzzzzzz makes me wonder what they're putting in sheryl's coffee. some reviewers are saying there's heart and soul all over this album? that may be but it's also very slick dullsville stuff too. as for the album cover graphics i don't see the roger dean yes covers or the 60's style psychedelia like one reviewer wrote but a very modern graphic art that lots of artists and bands have been using. kelly clarkson the vines the donnas the list goes on. highlights: good is good (i guess it's time for a new very best of collection) ,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive
 wow! tom morello flea pete yorn chris cornell brad wilk maynard james keenan. when i first heard of this superstar line-up i was sure that this cd was going to be awesome. i was duped like everyone else who bought this album. axis of justice (or so cleverly put by a previous reviewer as axis of jackasses) is really a bad album even for a bunch of political liberal rockers. serj and tom really dropped the ball with this one. what could've been a festoon of awesomeness turned out to crap-fest of whiny musicians with an equally crappy message. knowledge the night watchmen and ahmed ahmed are among the many reasons why this is so bad and incredibly difficult to listen to. the songjeffrey are you listenng? is up there with other crappy songs like john mayer's city love and richard harris' macarthur park. on top of all that the communist entertainer known as michael moore adds his little nugget of wisdom on the dvd which i can say i've become dumber now that i've listened to it. for the love of all good music stay far away from this cd ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 king elvis. queen madiona. prince justin. and now princess hillary! duff is slowly making her way up to the queen of pop. it was espicially nice to here my teen idol singing all christmas classics with some other pop stars too. if you love hillary duff and you really need some new cd's by her and it's crhistmas time then this is cd for you! let me tell ya somethin' that girl can sing. so go to the cd store. buy it! play it! plop down on the couch and have a glass of egg nog. ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 dan fogelberg is an extremely talented songwriter and performer. unfortunately the songs that get the most radio play are his weaker efforts songs that seem formulaic and &quot;safe.&quot; his best songs are the lesser known works -- listeners have to buy the albums in order to hear them. they'll never make it to the pop airwaves. serious fogelberg fans will be disappointed by this greatest hits cd. &quot;greatest hits&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;greatest music.&quot ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 i've had this cd since it came out and it continues to be my favorite. it's a cd that i can put in anytime and thoroughly enjoy. this would be my pick for the cd to have while stranded on an island. it never gets boring and made me appreciate just how good schon is. unbelievable. if you like this you'll like eric johnson's venus isle album too. two of my all time favorites ,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative

 with engines of creation joe satriani did what he has always done: make the most of the tools he chooses to use. only this time he uses electronic beats and soundscapes as the canvas on which to express his skill with the guitar. it would be easy to give this one listen and wonder where the guy who wrote satch boogie war and flying in a blue dream went. well he's still here only more than ever he's showing us his incredible command of his instrument by being able to create sounds that so perfecly reflect what they intend to convey. i've never heard robots having sex but i'm willing to be borg sex isn't far off. and although his calmly passing sometimes noodling melodies appear to have little structure that's kinda how you'd expect to see clouds race across the sky. the 'chorus' to devil's slide sounds as sinister as its name suggests and attack is as close to a musical sci-fi battle as i've ever heard. to top it off the album includes until we say goodbye one of satch's best ballads in his entire catalogue. if you're willing to put a little more mental energy into appreciating the work satch put into this album than just waiting for the album to rock your socks off surfing with the alien-style you'll find that there's an incredible amount of depth -- and musicianship -- to be found. it's not a satriani masterpiece but its a true testament to the man's enduring creativity ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive
 first of all i am a fan of madonna's music (not all of it but a lot of it) as well as a huge abba fan. now i realize that sampling has been very successful for many artists... and apparently it is here as well but why can't these producers make something more intriguing or dynamic? gimme gimme gimme (the abba song that is sampled here) is a fairly simple song to begin with (as many abba songs are) but the complicated arrangements (both vocally and instrumentally) are what made abba's songs interesting and fun to listen to. but taking a few bars of the original song repeating it over and over and over adding a dance beat various other musical effects and a new melody does not add up to a pop masterpiece. i think she would've been better off either following a similar chord progression to gimme gimme gimme or just doing a cover... perhaps benny and bjrn should've stuck to their strict no sampling rule here! for some reason many of today's dance/pop songs get too caught up in the production and lack any real substance... a good example of a radio-friendly dance/pop song with a somewhat complicated chord structure is acoustic alchemy's so kylie on their american/english album (the song sounds simple enough but if you really listen to what's going on you'll notice subtle chord changes and a really nice progression). now i'm not going to say hung up is a terrible song because everyone has their own taste. but i'm sorry to say it just doesn't do anything for me.. ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 this has been my first cd of rod stewart and i am very proud to have this cdbecause worth every penny. this cd has class. congratulations to the men behind. the duet with cher bewitched bothered & bewildered is the best song.duet with queen latifah as time goes by i was astonish she has a nice voice too!!. all songs are relaxings. actually i listen this cd before to go bed ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative
 having been a fan of joan osborne's take of son of a preacher man on her original indie record and heat wave from the recent 'standing in the shadows of motown' soundtrack i was looking forward to hearing this record of covers. i was ultimately disappointed. first of all i have to say there are two real gems on here that really needed to be updated one for its amazing vocal/instrumental sound (the spinners' i'll be there) and the other for its message (timmy thomas' why can't we live together). to be sure there are some great tunes on here that i am always up for listening to such as stevie wonder's love's in need of love today and undisputed truth's smiling faces somtimes but osborne adds little to these. when she does change things around the effect is questionable. i know that norah jones has brought back the torch song style but osborne's bluesy take on edwin starr's war is seriously misguided. the same is true when you rip the melody and add bland vocals to classics like aretha franklin's think or the band's the weight - especially since the former could have really used some punch from such a powerful singer like osborne. overall this was a missed opportunity. i hope her upcoming 2005 record is a reinvention ,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative

 i am a big ambrosia fan and i love biggest part of me you're the only woman how much i feel and the newer track i just can't let go. however i wish this cd contained all of their billboard hot 100 hits. the cd is missing their cover of magical mystery tour (#39) and how can you love me (#86). for the casual listener this cd is perfect. for the chart hit completionists out there it misses a couple songs. i bought this cd used for $1.99 which was a huge bargain for the songs included. for that price i can certainly try to download the missing tracks ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative
 i cant understand how anyone can give this album more than one star. luckily i got this cd for free when they were handing them out to everyone who came to their shows on their 2005 tour. i love classic journey but this band has gone downhill faster than i ever thought possible. most of the songs are terrible-boring music and even worse lyrics. 'arrival' was pretty mediocre but this is about 5 steps down from there. granted steve augeri does complete justice to the old songs in concert and really sounds great but he obviously has nothing to offer in the way of songwriting. the only way this band will ever create quality new music is if perry were to stop sitting around at home and come back to the band. otherwise the band should seriously consider not making any more new music and just go on tour every couple of years ,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative
 every singer ends up attempting sinatra eventually but few manage so well.... john pizzarelli has been playing jazz guitar with his legendary father bucky since he was 6 years old. john's latest album is dear mr. sinatra on which he plays songs written for ol' blue eyes.... the crooner is noted for his sensitive phrasing and powerful interpretative voice which recall the relaxed stylings of nat king cole and chet baker as well as for his fluid inventive guitar playing. on this album of covers of songs made famous by frank sinatra john pizzarelli wisely avoids the pitfalls of ol' blue eyes imitations in favor of his own intimate approach best heard on the set's more relaxed arrangements. my highlights are the tracks i've got you under my skin nice and easy and you make me feel so young. both attention-grabbing and supportive his expertly arranged big band accompaniment likewise evokes the ring-a-ding-ding of the rat pack era while steering clear of mere pastiche. with a total time just under 40 minutes the program is a little short by cd standards but the performances by john pizzarelli and the clayton-hamilton jazz orchestra in this warm tribute to frank sinatra are consistently of high caliber and hit the mark every time. ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative

 wow did someone slip the wrong cd into my jewelbox or what? if you're a fan of allison's other work epect nothing like what you've heard before. this is mostly a pop album and the songs that could have been saved are ruined by the awful engineering. the sound is way over compressed and artificial sounding. even allisons voice has no drive to it. steve earl is no match on the guitar for joe mcmahan who played on the show cd/dvd. ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 wild card is the best song on this cd. the rest just didn't do it for me and i didn't care for the latin flavor. this cd was a mess. if the rest of the songs were along the lines of wild card i would have kept the cd. this didn't say rippingtons to me. ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative
 this cd is a classic a must for all those who loved the movie. i wondered if i would get a crackling type of sound but it is as crystal clear as the movie sound. this is perfect for those who want to practice the songs for a sound of music event or a singing class! ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 the animals a group that included eric burdon and alan price were the first major pop stars to emerge from newcastle a city located about 300 miles north of london therefore far removed from where most talent scouts were searching. it is fortunate for us all that the animals were discovered because they recorded some of the best r+b music to come of the uk in the sixties. their biggest hit was house of the rising sun a re-working of a folk song (apparently inspired by josh white's version of the song) that gave them a transatlantic number one hit. they had five other top ten uk hits with mickie most these being i'm crying don't let me be misunderstood (a cover of a nina simone song) bring it on home to me (a sam cooke cover) we gotta get out of this place (the version included here is the uk version - a markedly different recording was released in america but was unavailable for inclusion in this set) and it's my life. apart from their singles the animals recorded many other covers including boom boom dimples i'm mad again (all john lee hooker) around and around memphis tennessee how you've changed (all chuck berry) i'm in love again i've been around (both fats domino) talking about you hallelujah i love her so and i believe to my soul (all ray charles). these covers clearly demonstrate what their main influences were but they also wrote some of their own songs. all the music i've mentioned so far and much more can be found on this excellent compilation. nevertheless despite the title of the compilation it isn't actually their complete recordings - there is a sub-text explaining that these are the complete recordings that they made with mickie most as producer although the liner notes describe their whole career. after the split they switched to another record label where they had some success using the name eric burdon and the animals including two more uk top ten hits (don't bring me down san franciscan nights) and several lesser hits all of which can be found elsewhere (search for eric burdon). alan price left the group before the split with mickie most and had several hits as a solo singer. these are also outside the scope of this collection but are easy to find. this complete collection (apart from the american version of we've got to get out of this place) of the first and most important part of the animals' career may be more than some people want - there are single cd collections available if you just want the hits - but if like me you like to explore beyond the hits this is for you ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative
 aretha's voice her style delivery and interpretation of her music is incomparable. these songs are more than just classics; they're a songbook to millions of people's lives who grew up listening to her in the 60's and 70's as i did. they evolk memories of times that changed our world and showed just how powerful and influential music could be for generations to come. there is not much that came before and very little that came after these golden years for aretha that can compare to this treasury of her music. sadly the aretha frankiln of 2007 pales in comparison to the aretha franklin of this time who was truly and rightfully the queen of soul. ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 i was anxious to hear an astounding modern yet retro dance disc from one of my favorite girl groups of the 80s. unfortunately instead of picking up on the latest influence of 80s music in dance music what we get here is predominantly disco flavored tracks that sound painfully dated with some latin tones now and then. the only semi retro/electro tracks on here (and my favorites) are feel for you love bite your love is like a drug and marc almond's remix of venus. the two lead singles move in my direction and look on the floor are not even the strongest tracks! and the remixes on their singles don't make them much better. i appreciate the commercial direction the girls have taken but you can still sound mainstream while being more sophisticated than this. take a listen to the new madonna or even the kelly osbourne(!) to hear some infectious melodies with an 80s flair that don't melt down into total cheese. unfortunately i just don't see us radio embracing any of the sounds on this disc. but of course fans of bananarama should still add this one to their collection. it's listenable if not up to today's standards ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative

 flcl is the worst anime of all time and possibly the worst thing to come out of japan since the pearl harbor attacks and the soundtrack is just as bad if not worse. its nothing more than j-pop mixed with bad japanese rock. bad guitar playing boring drum beats and inaudible bass; you've heard one pillows song you've heard them all. only otakus with no life love this s*** (like matthew g. salisbury). if you want good japanese music go for king's evil. ps that album cover is possibly the worst ever made ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive
 i just purchased this album my first misfits album and every song on it rocks (i especially like where eagles dare). i just bought two more albums walk among us and static age and i wish they would hurry up and get here in the mail because i cant wait. my only complain is the sound quality. it sounds like they put a dollar store tape recorder in the corner and started rocking...but i guess that makes it sound more real too. metallica covered a couple of their albums on their garage album but it just isnt the same. ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative,positive
 like it says in the (33 1/3) liner notes: ...world class chops and originality. if jazz is your bag and guitar licks get your attention these tracks will set off fireworks! my music collection started circa 1960 but these guys made it to the top of my list in a heartbeat! if i could i'd give it 10 stars ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative
 toad the wet sprocket have to be one of the most underated bands of the ninties. they wrote some brilliant material and a lot of the songs on this album are very enjoyable. but there are some strange ones that are do not appeal to my taste. my fave song is 'is it for me'. it is hard to classify them though. it sort of deep and meaningful (at most times) pop rock. other good tracks include walk on the ocean pray your gods and i will not take...etc. i regard this album and 'dulcinea' as their two best albums ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive
 im not surprised that this album is garbage because fiddy has been putting out trash lately (think tony gayo). there are no standout tracks and prodigy doesnt even rhyme anymore. all prodigy does is spit run-on sentences throughout every track and havoc sounds like he's just there to be there. amerikaz nightmare was a sign that it was over for them. did we really have to hear this one to see that? if you are a mobb deep fan buy every album before amerikaz nightmre and keep it moving ,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 nwa was an original rap group and with that being said this is definitely a must have album for rap lovers. along with public enemy nwa christened their genre with hard core lyrics and tight bass beats. although i don't agree with some of their lyrics one would not expect this white kid to fully understand their view on life. anyways buy this album i recommend it. keep it away from the kiddies though ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative
 generally on amazon.com the average rating of an album does not accurately indicate its quality - that is the albums are usually highly overrated. this is probably due to the voluntary nature of the reviews and the fact that the fans of an artist are far more likely to review their albums and give them high scores than a casual music listener giving them the score they deserve. as a result of this generally albums that have an average score of 4.5 - 5 stars are usually excellent albums. ones with a score of 4 are generally good and 3.5 indicates a pretty average album. average scores any lower than 3.5 stars generally indicate a pretty poor album. as i mentioned before due to the high proportion of fans reviewing albums the average score rarely falls below 3 stars. it takes a pretty horrendous album like limp bizkit's results may vary to get a score of even 2.5. in fact i didn't even think that it was possible for an album to get less than 2.5 - that is until i saw this pile of feces. now to put this average score of 2 into context - this means that the proportion of hataz reviewing this album is even more than the proportion of fans reviewing it. out of all the terrible albums i have viewed i have never seen this happen before. not even to bands as terrible as limp bizkit or even an*l c*nt. this obviously indicates a decline in fan numbers and hopefully the end of chingy's 15 minutes of fame ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative

 first show on broadway i ever left at intermission. i bought the tickets because i didn't think i could go wrong seeing a show directed by strohman starring craig bierko who was fantastic in music man and was flat flat flat in this show and music by harry connick jr. whom i have loved forever. it taught me that everything has it's place and harry's place is not a broadway stage. i hope for his sake he does not try again. if i could rate something at zero stars this would get that rating ,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative

 as a band the byrds are one of the greatest and certainly one of the most influential bands in rock and roll history. adding to that legacy mr. tamborine man's status as one of the greatest debut albums in rock history is almost without question. this band could do it all; country folk rock jam psychedelica etc etc. and this debut was perhaps the pinnacle of their achievements. though they would venture into much more adventurous territory (notorious byrd brothers) this was where the band was the most solid the most tight collectively. dylan's influence is everywhere from the get-go; 4 of his songs span the album including the title track which the byrd's turned into his only #1 hit. elsewhere there are two other covers but the songs with the best longevity are originals mostly penned by gene clark. witness the tortured romance of i'll feel a whole lot better and here without you and tell me he wasn't a great songwriter. roger mcguinn (or jim if you like) was quick about finding his signature nasally croon that would go on to influence tom petty among others. obviously not everyone had found their place; songs by chris hillman and david crosby are nowhere to be found. but mr. tamborine man stand today every bit as tall as the early works of dylan and the beatles. this is the album that set the standard for folk-rock from then on from buffalo springfield to rem to toad the wet sprocket to the most current emo bands. overall: 10 out of 10 ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

 i remember this album well; you could hardly call it a 'barnstormer' as it was released well before under the bridge made them the bandwagon band of the year but nothing could hide the fact that this was a band hellbent on proving the critics right--they never had a good album. for every song worth listening to (suck my kiss give it away) there were at least four more songs that should have been discarded. this album was and remains a perfect example of why bands shouldn't feel obliged to slam 50 minutes of crap onto a slab of aluminum just because they can. on top of that the vocals were pitched and pro-tooled beyond belief. some friends and i got a chance to see the band when they were supporting this album and kiedis was so off-key it wasn't funny. they drowned their sound in reverb so to try and drown out his lousy vocals but the damage was done. people were walking out in droves ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 great fan of the man they call 'sugar' zucchero but this outing is really below par. this cd consists of rerecordings of older songs with the addition of other famous singers. did he send the original recordings to these people en did they ad little pieces here and there? it sounds like it! none of the songs have gotten' better compared to the originals. to me this cd is a total rip off intended to make easy money (and get more attention for 'sugar' outside of italy?). don't buy it get 'oro' 'shake' or 'blue sugar' instead ,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative
 if the name pink floyd wasn't on this cd who would really rate it higher that one or two stars ? i am a pink floyd fan but i have to say that i don't like any of their early works. to me the band begins to make great stuff with meddle and their first cd were boring even with the pink floyd name on it. the only good track is childhood's end the other tracks are poor ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 ok first off this is the first corrs release i've listenend to. i'm offering my opinion without knowing anything else they may have done. i've listened to the cd 10 times or so on random occasions when i need a break from my normal diet of punk and garage rock. it sounds good. a little too good. i agree that it's overproduced doesn't sound even remotely spontaneous. the studio work is well done but overdone. i'd like to hear something else to see what they really sound like. the content of the songs is what bothers me. aside from being sappy sentimental drivvel (this is pop music after all - i wasn't expecting anything else) everything sounds like a commercial ditty or a part of a movie soundtrack. mmm-hmm. track 1 - i see a not-so overweight soccermom smiling on a treadmill at curves(tm) then hopping in the ford expedition(tm) and cheering on the kids at their soccer game with a sunnyd(tm) in each hand. track 2 - helicopter pans out as mid-20's girl drives curvy mountain road in vw cabrio(tm)(r) with top down thinking about handsome lover... lmn(r) watermark in lower-right corner of screen... track 3 - sad animals. images of puppys in cages. track 4 - actually i like this one. mellow laid back. track 5 - ugh. track 6 - this one is the most clever! i see the band members - 3 girls 1 guy - on one side of a table under a hanging lamp in an otherwise black room while 3 gentlemen in suits open a breifcase full of money push it towards them and say as you're aware the radio has lost it's credibility. the kids are figuring out that there are other bands out there beside what we pump across the airwaves at them. we need to entice them back. if you want a single and this pile of cash says you do then you'll do what you can to save this dying medium. hell you work in the word radio and we'll double what we're giving you. come on the song even sounds like a psa for the international radio marketing council... track 7 - sounds like a pepsi commercial. track 8 - ugh. wait wasn't this track 5? track 9 - sappy but ok. sounds like they actually put effort into the lyrics. thumbs up. track 10 - not remotely original but alright. track 11 - interesting sound. good beat. correct me if i'm worng but was that a semi-pagan reference there? that would be a bold move for which i'd applaud them if in fact it is. not that i'm pagan or anything but hey its a religiously positive non-christian reference that doesn't involve marilyn manson and that takes guts. especially for radio-loving girls bands. track 12 - laid back. almost has a jazzy lounge feel. track 13 - produced by former ace of base member? bubbly upbeat not too bad. track 14 - written and produced by avril lavigne... track 15 - wow! a relatively celtic-sounding song from a relatively celtic band!! and instrumental too - big thumbs up! in fact maybe that's the key. whatever. long-winded i know but fair. this album didn't turn me off to the corrs completely but i don't have very high hopes now. flame away kiddies. ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive
 ...unless it is rock and roll played by ac/dc. i f***ing hate them. they are overplayed so much on the radio and that is the most annoying voice i have ever heard in my life. don't waste your money on this cd just turn on the radio...then turn it off ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive
 forget the fact that despite the grumbling about today's music too many people just swallow and digest the slop record companies throw at them hollaback girl is the absolute dumbest song i've ever had the displeasure to hear. there are two main parts to this travesty: 1. where she says that's my sh** no less than a million times and 2. she demonstrates that she's hooked on phonics by being kind enough to spell bananas for the rest of us. if this is supposed to be rap stefani failed miserably. if it's supposed to be dance again she failed miserably. to be honest i don't know what the hell this is supposed to be because it sure isn't music. the fact that it was number one for so long proves that perhaps people don't have any requirements for their ears. - donna di giacom ,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative

 this cd was devoid of any of govi's usual emotional imprint or soaring guitar work. frankly it was just a bunch of new age background noise that one would hear on elevators. some of the craig chaquico-style stuff was interesting but better left to craig. try 7th heaven mosaico or guitar odyssey instead ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 this cd should not have been released because it adds really nothing to this jarrett quartet's other three releases. it's like taking a fat paint brush full of cheap house paint and making a greasy mess of what was a very beautiful triptych. belonging my song and nude ants are all virtuoso spiritually empowered performances and should by all means be purchased and enjoyed. but i'd go nada on this one if i were you. i was sitting with my 88-year-old mother listening to the last track and complaining about how lame it was and she said it was hum-drum. and she's 88 likes lawrence welk and it was past her bedtime. (it's past late night willie's bedtime too i hate to tell you.) heck i've heard high school jazz bands cook twice as hot as this keith and the somnambulists incarnation. garbarek sounds like he's going to give himself a hernia trying to get out the altissimos. i can't think of one interesting drum riff in the whole 61 minutes plus. (neither can christensen.) les scandinavianes sound like they need about 10 hours sleep and then maybe they start thinking about picking up musical instruments. jarrett is as wired as ever but even he can't keep up with some of the tempos and the overall mood is disoriented forced and cumbersome. how any reviewer can say that this release captures the quartet's tight integration displayed amazingly well elsewhere is beyond me. with the exception of innocence none of the compositions are very good either. oasis has an interesting if dire melody line but it can't summon the required ambience because of all of the clutter and dog poop around it. unlike the other three releases mentioned above this one has very little magnetism - the first track is all rambling rose jazz where none of the musicians are feeding off each other. i don't enjoy this kind of jazz so cliched and unintegrated. it contains that jarrettian need to rush things and gang jump the tempo with heavy-handed neurosis peddled as jazz fusion. you feel like some nut in a bmw is suddenly sitting 10 inches off your bumper too demented to use the passing lane. (yes i know keith has mastered his scales and likes to crack knuckles with tempos and yes i now have a headache.) there is an interesting part at the end however where garbarek cuts way back on the throttle and swaggers around in the lower and upper registers of his tenor sax in some nice ways. but the transition is contrived at best and bears no organic relation to the first part. only innocence benefits from the fact that these guys are probably taking a red eye flight to new york soon. it is a beautiful lullabye arguably jarrett's best composition. true the nude ants version is all you need really but something happens on this version of the song that is very special. jarrett puts in one of his best if not his best jazz piano performances. the composition is perfectly suited to his virtuosity and sensitivities and the somnambulists who are still pulling a code 9 can't screw it up even if they want to. (there is a halo around keith jarrett's head i bet you.) garbarek (somnambulist #1) plays the melody with a lot of heart but he screws up the tempo in a very brief weak improvisation. the man is tapped knows it and decides it's time to end the song. palle danielsson (somnambulist #2) misses a lot of notes (doubly bad on double bass) and goes off into an ill-conceived top-heavy improvisation right at the beginning of the song. like garbarek he knows enough to stop and retreat letting jarrett take over. i can't remember a dang thing about somnambulist #3 (christensen). but jarrett's effort cannot be touched and he plays like a true wizard. a week later at the village vangard (nude ants) they'll all be playing at this level. if anything i'd like to see the pm version of innocence included in a compilation of the best concert performances by this quartet rather than a whole release of this mediocre concert. for the most part here we get hum-drum mountains where many of the great riffs from the releases mentioned above are handled like a shaky old butler serving up tea with people getting burned and tablecloths getting ruined. in particular garbarek's performance on nude ants is far superior to this one and maybe the mean streets of greenwich village got his norwegian up. maybe they weren't so sure if they were going to make it back to the hotel alive - new york used to be like this you know - and well it just might be your last gig. on personal mountains it's all polite thank yous and japanese clapping robotically. not a tinkling glass of booze in the whole schmooze. not even a bonze meditating for more. but that manfred eicher such a card i tell you. ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 solas' previous cd &quot;words that remain&quot; is a classic in irish traditional music and the loss of karan casey certainly affects their sound on this album. however instrumentally they are incredibly strong and as inventive as ever and deirdre scanlon is a gifted singer with a wide range of styles. i don't think the choice of tracks is quite so strong but it is a powerful performance of a very high order of music. the instrumental playing at times leaves you breathless and the energy levels are very high. there are some lovely songs - i like &quot;bonnie mae&quot; and &quot;miner's life&quot; in particular and &quot;i will remember you&quot; is an original gem. i am disappointed to hear critics complain of the lack of &quot;traditional&quot; music on the cd and about the use of &quot;rock&quot; instruments. based on those criteria the only instruments tolerated would be harp uillean pipes wooden flute and fiddle (tin whistle (flageolet) guitar mandolin bouzouki accordion and banjo being modern foreign invaders)and what a pity! what defines traditional - is it pre-planxty? can no more traditional songs be written? seamus egan and co have done their apprenticeship in the rigorous disciplines from the book of traditional music (rhythm and melody) and have enriched it with a new chapter. in general i agree that bass and percussion is often unnecessary but in this case the augmentations are tasteful and generally effective. i would also highly revcommend liz carroll's &quot;lost in the loop&quot; although if you're a purist it has the solas rhythm section playing on it and features many of liz's &quot;brand new&quot; traditional tunes (brilliant) ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive

 bits of beatleszappa queen (herman's hermits ?) may be laudable in intent but reveals the crucial difference between an original musical mind and a talented imitator. elfman's themes are good but his songs have some of the same faults as your normal musical pieces they have fairly banal repetitive lyrics and are cut and paste music. has the creepy competence of a dave grusin album. if you like that you'll be ok here ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 the willie dixon chess set is a window into the early blues that was the basis for some of the most well known rock and roll songs of all time. from led zeppelin to the kinks willie dixon and his music was a source of inspiration and musical reinvention. sometimes you have to stay true to your roots. its an incredible journey into the heart of original blues ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive

 wow! i love this spykids movie way better than the first one. i think of the first one as an introduction for the characters and the sequel is the big adventure for all the cortezes and even more characters like the giggleses. we met donnagon in the first movie and he was the reason for the cortez parents to go on the mission. now we see that he has kids and we relize that he has bigger plans for the oss. and what about alexandra the preisidants daughter? she is the main reason we know about the transmooker device right? also grandma and grandpa cortez are joining us in this movie. i think robert rodregiuz did an execallent job on the sequel spy kids 2: the island of lost dreams. ... the sequel is awesome!!!! ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative

 having been a casual fan of stax records for a few years; i decided earlier this year that i should go all out and splurge on this 9-cd box set. big mistake. i have many many complaints about this set; but what it basically boils down to is that this whole set is an absolute mess. it misses many key b-sides such as otis redding's hard to handle and booker t & the mg's tic tac toe; and doesn't even include every a-side the label released despite the title of the compilation (where are the sides that hoyt johnson released for the label?). the linear notes by steve greenberg (the man who gave us that phony soul queen joss stone; and the headache-inducing baha men) are horrible mostly focusing on his personal opions of the artists and/or songs rather than the stories behind them. and within the sections for each disc in the booklet; they entries aren't actually arranged in any particular order (least of all the order of the tracks on the cds that would make too much sense). and there should've been more photos too. add to this the set's main problem: the music. the fact is that most of the songs on here are really lame. seriously. why did you buy it then? i hear you say. well; the stax songs i was familiar with (such as green onions; b-a-b-y; you don't miss your water; (sittin' on) the dock of the bay; soul man; born under a bad sign etc) are all great songs. well why don't you like this set then you're thinking. answer: because the 30-or-so great songs on here are sandwiched between over 200 filler songs over 9 discs. if you think i'm being harsh on these songs i'm not; i can appreciate songs like wendy rene's bar-b-q and the memphis nomad's don't pass your judgement; but aside from a few good numbers and a few pleasent-but-dull numbers most of the non-hits on here are pretty bad. basically if you really like a stax artist then go and buy a best-of for that artist; if your looking for a sampler of stax's best songs then go and buy the 4-cd stax story; don't bother with this one ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 we started playing this for our one year old when we were driving on a short trip out of town. as babies sometimes do she began screaming and was unconsolable... until we turned on rocket ship beach. polly wolly doodle calmed her right down and continues to do so. we played that song at least 6 times in a row that day! now that she's a little older she points to the cd player in the car if something else is playing requesting her cd be played. i've always enjoyed a wide range of music and was afraid that after having a child we'd be reduced to listening to watered down kid music like that purple dinosaur and those australian guys. there is a mixture of classics reimagined and new songs that i find myself humming all of the time. there is a good variety of instrumentation and styles. our daughter claps at the end of her favorites and often waves her arms about. got kids? buy this cd! ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 this is a really great cd. the candian and american idol winners are not usually that great but melissa is an exception. she just belts out her soul whenever she's at the microphone. my absolute favourite is definitely alive. it's just a beautiful song. really i recommend this cd who likes songs with great messages and a good beat. she's a great pop/rock singer. you can't go wrong with this cd ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
 i've been listening to satoshi tomiie for a long time and this is definetly one of his best cd's yet. its one of those cd's that is a must have before a road trip. just play it and let it ride. from beginning to end it keeps your ears on high alert just waiting for that next track to hit. before you know it your at the end but who says you cant just hit repeat and start the ride all over again. ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative
 this album sends mixed messages to the listener. some tunes are overally happy some quite depressing. i can only explain it in parts: radio song - the first track of the album comes out quite upbeat and rollicking. a guest vocal from krs-one makes it quite a lively tune. puts you in the mood for a more green-style album. losing my religion - huh? what's this? the album delves into uneasy angst as a troubled stipe spills problems out to the listener. the tortured riff holds out until the end telling the listener this isn't quite like green or document... low - the depression lingers on. low is a tune sadened speech about the absence of love and how it can make you feel so low. my favorite on the album i think it's delicate and sad. my #1 downer tune. near wild heaven - another uneasy tune that has a touch of angst. deals with the apprehension of love. endgame - a curious tune. can't be interpreted either happy or sad for it is instrumental. it could go either way it's written in a major key yet the melody sounds sobered almost as if it's a requiem. shiny happy people - takes the listener up to a very uncomfortable level of happiness. a low point on the album yet i interprate it by feeling uneasily happy after the anti-pastorial earlier tracks. belong - one track i don't understand yet enjoy and see it as a break from the main goal of the album. half a world away - ah so beautiful. essentially about enjoying life's finer moments at the expense of moments to come. truly happy but still holds on to the softcore angst. texarkana - the lyrics and pulsing bass line make me draw conclusions that it's about unfulfilled life goals. delves deeper into seeds of depression until... country feedback - the climax of saddness on the album. this song is excruciatingly sad. the melody the lyrics... it kept me awake all night. one of the saddest songs i've ever heard. me in honey - a powerful joyous ending that basically sums up the fact the everything turns out ok in the end. this album is highly recomended. r.e.m. are an incredible band. ,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative
 i love this album but the other review from anonymous is wrong. this cd is not remastered. i baught this cd because of that review and got burned. the cd even says right on it aad. in other words analog recording/analog master/digital playback. i will say this much though the transfer is better than mca's version which i own. however if you want a remastered version of the song monster look to the all time greatest hits/original recording remasterd cd from mca. it also has move over from this cd i love this cd and want it remastered. if you gotta have this album (i do) than this version sounds better than the mca version ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative

 perhaps it's a bit unfair because lucinda engenders such high expectations but i was really disappointed with this record the songwriting is weak the singing is weak and the arrangements are dull something kicked all the life out of the music--the songs are not all the same but for some reason they all sound the same--and embarrassingly you can sing most of them after one listen they are so simplistic and cliched ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 this recording is not great company. i'm really confused: is it a broadway recording or a very poor amatuer recording? and if so did this rubbish actually make it to the broadway stage? i feel for the people that saw it and were expecting the rich full melodies that sondheim produced for this show. the musical director for this abomination should be called a mutilation director because that is precisely what he did to the music of this show. so the only advice i give to future musical directors that want to revive and revamp a show: if it's not broke please please please don't try and fix it! some things are just perfect the way they are. don't buy this cd. i did and it is now a coaster where it gets better use ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative

 i gave 2 star for this cd not because of the musical quality...but because the last song goodnight my love is cut short on this cd. after watching the live performance on cable i rushed out to buy this cd labeled by hybrid. only to find out my favorite song goodnight my love was cut short. on the cd it ends with the sax doing a solo then fades away....which leaves the song dangling and unfinished!!! on the video this song ends with art singing bring you closer to me and the music slowly ends beautifully correctly. there's a version out which was released by sony in 2003. i don't know if this version contains the full song. the hybrid label version is simply ridiculous!!! how can you possibly end such a beautiful song short!! leaving it unfinished....and well....short and listeners wanting more!!! if someone can verify if the sony conatins the full goodnight my love...or tell me where i can get this verson would really appreciate it ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative

 if you have children that are five years & younger this would be a good album to put in your child's boom box or get it in cassette for their tape player. but if your children are six and up. your better off finding the real songs and burning them if you can find these songs. this album should be saved strictly for the poor folks who wnat music for their kids but cannot afford it. this ablum would be number 1 if it were sold in rwanda sudan or other third world nations since it could be sold for like dirt cheap. parents if you buy this album after your children turn 6 years old. pack this cd and other ki8dz bop cd's and send them to africa. this is pop music for impoverished folks ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 back when blondie was being hailed as the biggest new-wave band in pop music by fans and critics alike there were also just as many critics that quickly dismissed blondie as bubblegum pop and one group that would never have staying power. but i think it's been observed enough how the group has had the last laugh. parallel lines helped establish blondie as a serious music group and turned their cult following into commercial success. this album is also the first where debbie harry's voice gets sharpened with the sensibility of a sweet vulnerable girl one minute to sultry and rapturous behind disco grooves the next. the album made punk pop and disco shake hands which was a method unheard of in 1978. songs like hanging on the telephone picture this pretty baby and sunday girl have become irresitable pop gems while i know but i don't know and fade away & radiate featuring a terrific guitar lick by robert fripp are punk-driven classics. last but not least are the two hits that are forever getting played on the classic rock stations of today in one way or another and heart of glass. and how has debbie harry played out as lead singer after all these years? as rolling stone stated when this album was ranked #140 on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time madonna was surely watching. ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive
 being an osmond fan can be very frustrating at times... this cd has nothing new to offer. there have been several osmond compilation cds in the past 10 years. what's so different about this one besides the photograph on the cover? nothing. i agree with the reviewer who wishes the osmonds would put some of their old albums on cd instead of putting out hit compilation cds all the time. been there. done that. bored to tears ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 blues singers shouldn't try to go mainstream. if they do try and succeed fine. that means they've stayed true to their roots. when they try and fail (as susan has done with hope and desire) one would hope they'd try to get back to where they started. for me that was just won't burn. i guess when one is happily married with children it's hard to sing the blues since you're not feeling them . . . you're faking them ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 if you liked the original clerks soundtrack then you're sure to love this. thirteen years after we heard randall and dante rant and ramble on about hermaphrodites and name-calling during sex on the first clerks soundtrack now we are blessed with the opportunity to hear these two anti-heroes discuss other pointless issues like racial slurs and which movie trilogy is in fact the real trilogy. and we the clerks fans get to hear these meaningless dialogues in between every music track. oh and did i mention the music? terrific! kevin smith's choices are so fitting for each scene in the movie. it's not too difficult to imagine that kevin has been thinking about these track choices for a long time. in typical kevin smith fashion the usual array of artists are included as well as some cool surprises. you've got your typical soul asylum and alanis morrisette as well as king diamond and an unexpected jackson 5 dance number. if you have not seen the movie please make sure to do so before purchasing the soundtrack. doing so is sure to give the songs so much more meaning as you listen to them. overall a really good soundtrack compilation that is sure to please any clerks fan. ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative
 another typical funk classic album from the brilliant tenor sax sounds of lou donaldson. the album released on blues notes features lou's popular and individual classic jazz funk tones. lou even opts to 'chill' out on a number called 'over the rainbow' but on other numbers like 'donkey walk' lou's style and also his unique band really shine. the unmistakable hammond adds yet more funk and along with the jazzy guitar sound and funk and swinging drums this brings together another great album.keep on funkin mr lou donaldson!!!! ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 i bought this based on reviews of bass queen in the mix. to me it sounds like the west coast edition of northern exposure without the 4/4 house beat. in other words its very electronic sounding almost completely non-vocal and not very funky at all. i listened to eargasm by plump dj's and icey's funky breaks after this and it's definitely missing variety skill in mixing and that neck snapping funky quality that make the plumps and icey so indispensible. not too bad but not that interesting either. i prefer her mixtress and still have not heard bass queen... btw my speakers are flat down to below 30 hz and i didn't find the recording quality or the bass that impressive. listen to crystal method's phd or block rockin' beats by chemical brothers after this to see what i mean ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 i heard the first beat lp (&quot;i just can't stop it&quot;) in a small town record shop in 1980 and instantly fell in love with this band's brand of ska/soul/rock. for some strange reason i never bought &quot;wha'ppen&quot; and never got familiar with it. i confess to reading some less than enthusiastic reviews and shying away. of course i did buy &quot;special beat service&quot; and found it to be par excellent. so i ordered &quot;wha'ppen&quot; a couple of months ago and it arrived a few weeks back and i've been wearing it out. damn! how did i miss this? this is a great collection of snaky sweet politically smart songs. &quot;doors of your heart&quot;... i've loved that song for years... and &quot;too nice to talk to&quot; has always been a favorite. but every other single song on this cd including the bonus tracks is outstanding. these songs are textural wonders. great stinging guitar work and the incredible saxa on his horn make this a stunning recording. i regret not discovering it sooner but it sure is a nice find after-the-fact. oh yeah... one more thing... i had the pleasure of meeting dave wakeling in nashville this past summer and he's a very nice fellow who cares about the people that support him. if he comes to a venue near you don't miss the show. you'll get your money's worth and more. wear your dancin' shoes. he is truly one of the great talents of the 80's and continues to make significant music. he may be the most underrated recording artist of the past two decades. buy this cd. you won't regret it. it sounds best in the early evening. i'm the big oh and i gotta go ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
 ethereal rhythmic haunting eclectic. wake: best of dead can dance is a collection of songs that will move your soul and spirit. the haunting combination of modern and ancient tunes combined with phenomenal vocals and instrumentals make this album one to cherish and listen to over and over. each time you hear it will lead to new discoveries and emotions. ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative
 ...when you're gearing up for suicide. this whole album sounds like the last thoughts and comments of a person who's going to just end it all. i found myself suffering nightmares fatigue misery and paranoia. my ears unclogged but i started getting headaches and a fuzzy feel in my head. this is not a good album for the stressed because it will just make you feel worse. i find this album unlikable and mostly unenjoyable. when i first listened to it it sounded inaccessable after listening to it more and more i started to get more into it but i can't say i found it a good place to be in. it's a somewhat interesting album but it mostly just dragged me down made me nervous numb and hurt my head. people say this is great music. let them say what they want. give me some old fashioned enjoyable music that doesn't make a pest of itself. kid a is just ok to me and hasn't been worth all the effort to get into. this almost seems like a sadomasochistic album to spank the listeners. i don't know maybe i'm missing something but to hear some weird music like this that has miles more heart and is alot kinder to the ears try passengers by u2. and thom york sings like a muppet on this album. by the way i've enjoyed radiohead's first three albums quite a bit (including pablo honey -- why are people always busting its chops). ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative

 i borrowed this cd from a public library having liked the track crazy life on the empire records soundtrack and i was immediately blown away by how consistently good coil is the whole way through. it is their most mature album full of gentle emotion and idealism and puts the listener in a good mood. glen phillip's voice is unique confident and beautiful. i fell in love immediately with rings and dam would break. the haunting and beautiful harmonies captivate. little buddha is so different but so good as well. after i got coil i bought two of toad's older albums: fear and dulcinea. both are really good but something keeps drawing me back to coil. it is achingly beautiful vibrant thoughtful and pleasurable. it is hearing toad at their best. ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 metallica were simply one of the worst most overrated and pathetic bands ever. most of their trite albums deserve no stars. their only good cds are either master of puppets or black album. kill em all is such a bore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! james hetfield the lead singer just screams and can't sing at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!why???? why can't he sing more proper like lou greamm(foreigner) & mark knopfler(dire straits)???????? each and every song on this album is bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! don't listen to the people who rate metallica's albums a five star. they are overrated....green day is better. get them dire straits and foreigner insted. ps. this album is worth a minus trillion. ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 this album is the worst dcfc album why......... ill tell you why its boring its repetitive its way to mellow and im all for mellow but this is ridculous. i mean this is the type of mellow that puts people to sleep especially the last track. oh my god!!! that song is sooooo boring its called stability and it will put you to sleep. i am a fan of dfcf and i loved their other albums we have the facts plans etc..... but honestly this album did not click with me. i tried listing to the songs again to see if i would probably grow accustome to it but no that didnt work. sure this album has its moments but trust me when i say your not missing out on anything. i would not buy the album instead buy the 2 stand out songs off itunes or napster; a movie script ending and we laugh indoors. the only 2 stand out tracks ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 tears for fears was not the average 80's pop band even if they looked like it on the surfice. they used synthsizers drum machines with a meliodic and hook laden sound. but the music itself was often melancholy and they brought up serious issues like family values like few contemporary bands at the time had the guts to sing about. tears for fears got their name from arthur janov's primal scream therapy and they band consisted of roland orzabal and curt smith two highschool friends from bath england. roland was the writer of most songs during the career while they both were co-singing. some of the music may sound a little dated today (this being released in 1983) but the touchy subjects they bring up are still present today. the opener and title track is a great pop song and at the same time a good introduction to what is coming it's about children suffering without anyone noticing or caring. tears for fears trademark was mixing good pop with serious subjects and they really succeeded with that. mad world was one of the big hits and recently covered by gary jules and taken back to the charts again as the sountrack for donnie darko. the moody alternative song brings up the sad reality we're living in a world without rules or morals and the people suffering from it. excellent and haunting ballad. pale shelter was originally released in 1982 but failed to make it big on the charts so the song was re-recorded remixed and re-released and the result was a big hit even for pale shelter. the song is slow paced and distinct with guitars synthesizers and percussion. it brings up the lack of love some children get cause of bad parenthood. ideas as opiates is almost minimalistic it basically only feauture percussion and slow piano sound the lyrics are also sparse. memories fade is also a stripped and melancholy song with it's haunting lyrics and saxophone it's one of this album's highlights. suffer them children is a synth laden pop song about children with problems growing up cause they're ignored and not given too much love. watch me bleed got very strong lyrics heaven comes to he who waits/ but i know im getting nowhere/ and all the deeds of yesterday /have really helped to pave my way and is overall another great pop/rock song. change was one of three big hits on this album it got a trademark marimba sound and a great hook which paved the way to the charts. the song is focusing on the destructive behavior of a loved one. the prisoner is the darkest of songs with some very strong lyrics and arrangements suited for a horror film the lyrics are sparse and they're almost whispered. the last song is called start of a breakdown feautures a catchy synthesizer sound and meliodic percussion. why this song was not released as single is beyond me but it's one of the best songs. this remastered version feauture remixed of pale shelter mad world and change and the non-album song the way you are is present. it's another fantastic song by the way. uptempo with great percussion arrangements. nice it was added. overall tears for fears magnificient debut was one of the most daring and thoughtful albums of the 80's. it's equally intellegent and beautiful full of good lyrics and great arrangements. with this remastered version you get better sound + bonus tracks and the non album song the way you are. some of the songs may sounds a little dated today considering all the new equipment used in today's music but the lyrics and subjects they brought up are just as present in today's society. this album may get a little too personal and the lyrics get frightening when you listen closely to them at times however if you're a music fan that likes smart lyrics and lyrics that make sense then this is something for you. it's a concept album and it very thoughtful and sincere. one of the greatest debuts of the 80's let alone albums. ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive

 some reviews have suggested that this is not the ideal first purchase for the un-inititiated. i am writing to confirm that assertion. i have read enough raving reviews about their subsequent releases to know that it really does get better from here but what a disappointment this album was for me. it sounds like what you would hear coming from the garage next door. my advice to the kids would be to keep practing and please turn it down. jack's appreciation of the blues is admirable but only realised on the song i fought piranhas. tellingly this is the final song on the album. otherwise the songs are forgettable and even annoying at times. ,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative

 understand i love springsteen. born to run is my second favorite album of all time. i have seen him live over a dozen times. i personally think he is the single most important american rock and roll artist ever (with apologies to elvis chuck berry and dylan). i even loved nebraska so don't tell me it's an e-street band thing or a rock versus folk thing but this album is unlistenable. some reviewers have called it beautiful and powerful. that's rubbish. there is a complete absence of melody on this record as was the case with much of the ghost of tom joad album (with a huge exception being youngstown - a great song). the apparently willful attempt to alter his singing style to sound like woody guthrie or jimmy rodgers is just frightening. dylan could pull it off bruce just disappoints. but it's the songs and lack of anything remotely resembling melody that makes this record a failure. believe i listened to devil & dust 10-15 times in hopes of finding what i am apparently missing. i couldn't. i thought the rising was a nice album. i even liked the devils & dust solo tour (bruce is a powerful performer and maybe even more commading when it's just him on stage) but i doubt this cd will ever find its way back into the player ,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive
 vet producer don was is aboard for this one and he pushes the ladies to write some of their most mature material relying on their trademark humour as a flavoring rather than a sole ingredient. the result is that even the radio tailored material is better than on stunt. best tracks here are: lovers sparring in too little too late twangy go home (possibly the only time you'll hear a country tune with glockenspiel. parental warning: this is one you'll want to skip if young ears are in the car because of a gratuitous f-bomb at the coda..) the tale of a co-worker dalliance in conventioneers that ends with them feeling awkward about it (so i wait come in late it'd be great if you transferred out of state) the cheater finally caught in humour of the situation (have you heard the one about the boy who moved into the henhouse to sleep? he woke up with egg on his face when he found that all the hens had crossed the street) and the ethereal tonight is the night i fell asleep at the wheel which utilizes an almost disneyish melody in its tale of a man in a traffic accident who disembodied surveys his own demise (in all the confusion there's something serene i'm just a posthumous part of the scene). the least interesting tracks are off the hook another cheater gets him comeuppance tune and baby seat a gentle nudge to accept responsibility instead of wanting others to look after you. bottom line: while not as consistently fabulous as gordon this one hits on all cylinders more than it misses and it utilizes more of the band's talents by allowing more lead vocals from ed robertson (pinch mefalling for the first time) as well as kevin's first on the hidden track hidden sun. you also hear the ladies do things they haven't before: steven's flute on tonight's the night i fell asleep at the wheel tyler's 808 drums for off the hook and a dash of retro courtesy of ed's wah-wah pedal on conventioneers and kevin's vocoder on humour of the situation ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative

 this album is incredible. for me this is one of those few albums that defines a time in my life. an album that for months i played over and over. an album that i've played countless times that i have passed out to when i came home after a late night that i have ran to and worked out to that i play at work for a pick-me up. it's great. it's filled with so much emotion and passion from beginning to end its just brilliant the entire album. the songs are composed more like classical music with sweeping scores that start off slow and steady and then build up and explode into these intense jams. i love it. you have to buy this album. then buy their next self titled album. then play it and play it and play it. it grows on you. i can't wait to see them live... ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 i was disappointed when i received this cd. although it is original the music is hard for me to listen for more than a minute or two. by your side (my favorite) is good for about two minutes. then the beat gets off track and starts to sound terrible. if this was done on purpose i cannot fathom why. i know this is lo-fi but a hint of bass wouldn't hurt at all. as it stands the cd sounds like an unfinished product and is not nearly good enough to stand on its own. i think this cd would best be used for some sampling...especially in today's hip-hop. if you are looking for beautiful relaxing music...look elsewhere ,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative
 this album lacks a lot of the controversy (not all of it) of the original uncensored &quot;cop killer&quot; (new censored version now titled body count). go to ebay and find someone auctioning off the real version of the 92 album. you will like it a hell of a lot better ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative
 i have followed the enigma project for a long time and haven't found myself disappointed with a single release thus far. (that is considering i am reviewing an older album.) 'the cross of changes' the second chapter in the enigma project offers philosophical insight into micheal crtu's personal beliefs in the form of an 'enigmatic' symphony of soft composition and chanson. while each album seems to hold it's own unique interpretation of life i believe the purpose of this album is to inspire love peace and wholeness within its listeners. the lyrical value of 'the cross of changes' seems to surpass that of its instrumental quality which is at times rather poor in comparison to some of micheal's other works. however the lyrics are reassuring and inspiring none-the-less and make the entire experience worthwhile. buyers who are curious about enigma probably shouldn't start with this album as it seems to be one of those things you appreciate only after hearing some of the latter releases. (in my case at least.) the first album i purchased was 'love sensuality devotion' (the greatest hits album) -- a good start considering you will get a fair idea of what enigma is all about. by the way i am curious about track number 2 -- everytime i listen to it i faintly hear sandra chanting open your heart and push the limits... in the background though it could just be my imagination. it's strange that i mention that because 'push the limits' was released after this album ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 to much guitar drowns out all the other instruments. survivor was made famous by heavy keyboards and drums not guitars. i was expecting another burning heart is this love high on you. no songs on this albums have that sound. the vocals by jamison are top notch but none of the songs sound like the survivor i remember. survivor guitars were only there to complement the keyboards bass and drums not drive the whole song. i guess jim peterik was the man behind survivor all along. i give the cd 2 stars for fire makes steel the rest are throw aways. ***recommended for die hards only*** i highly recommend 'when seconds count' for anyone getting started with survivor ,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative

 well this isn't at the gates. nightrage reminds me of many old arch enemy guitar tunes that were so melodic. of course that leads into gus g. substituting chris on concerts being an excellent choice as they make very similar melodies. some people say this album is heavy which it is in some parts. but its melodic death there are no signs of thrash or anything. just great melodies great headbanging music. add this to your collection i think its better than sweet vengeance ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative

 it seems that even the best bands have only a finite number of great melodies in them and the flower kings exhausted theirs in their first four cds. here we have yet another double-helping of their ageless wisdom strewn across two cds to our fiduciary detriment. though not as crass and offensive as stolt's wall street voodoo or bodin's i am this is nevertheless lyrically naive to the level of silliness. there are a few good instrumental passages mixed in this release but not enough to justify its purchase. stolt said in a recent interview something to the effect that ...peace & love never go out of fashion... well neither does informed maturity and you won't find any of that in this group's recent output. just more utopian preaching and good vs. evil typecasting. their liner notes advocate sending money to greenpeace and amnesty international but i would counter that any american would be better investing their extra cash at st. jude's children's hospital. i'm going to sell my copy of paradox hotel and probably several more flower kings cds to do just that. there are some sick children out there who need our support and encouragement far more than these would-be hippies ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 shannon lawson is capable of a much better album. i saw him down in nashville when he was with the galoots and it was amazing! if they were to put out a cd i'm sure it would be one of my favorites. shannon has a voice and a talent for bluegrass music and that's what nashville should have let him do on his first solo cd. instead they gave it this generic overproduced sound leaving shannon sound like everyone else. with the way bluegrass is selling these days it's a shame that shannon couldn't showcase his enormous talent in the proper arena.. ,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative

 the only problem with betty buckley is that she isn't nearly as well known as she deserves to be considering the length and quality of her career. this album of somgs from her 1996 aids benefit concert at carnegie hall is simply flawless. naturally it's heavy on music from broadway the london stage and film scores but she sings one mary chapin carpenter song &quot;come on come on&quot; that comes from none of those sources and is guaranteed to give you chills every time you hear it. if you're tired of recordings by singers of little talent and less style listen to betty buckley for fifteen minutes and you'll feel as if you'd never heard real singing before. she is an original and she has the best voice in theater of this or almost any decade ,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 it's impossible to like all of country music but randy travis is liked by even those who don't like country music. from 1986 and through the 90's he was always on top or near the top of the country charts. his calm nasal drawl reminds me a bit of lefty frizell but there's no mistaking his unique style. these are some of the best recordings in the history of country music including digging up bones forever and ever amen too gone too long is it still over? hard rock bottom of your heart etc. randy had 16 no. 1's on the country charts. there are 20 cuts here. if you only want one cd with all his greatest hits this is your logical choice. by the way the sound from rhino is bright and punchy and the booklet features dates neat pixs and peak positions. you've got a winner for life with this one! ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive
 apart from the great selection of soundtracks what really makes this compilation top value is the quality of the sound processing. executed with finesse these tracks sound better than when first issued and many are unedited fuller versions: like singing in the rain for example. throw in the great price and this double disc set is a must have for all lovers of classic movie music ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative
 this was one of those rare performances where dylan's raw energy swept the stage and transformed these selections from his collection into somthing entirely new and great. the sound is rough the intonation is off the recording is filled with horrible buzzes whistles and clicks. none of which matters. once youe listened to some of the tracks on this disk you'll prefer them to the original album cuts. i know i do. absolutely essential to any collection of dylan's work hard rain is not to be missed. ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative

 this is quite a sharp turn from francine's previous album (40 on a fall day)... whereas the last album was closer sonically to frontman clayton scoble's work in poundcake this time around it's quieter subtler sweeter and sadder. make no mistake this is a break-up album. even those songs that make no mention of breaking up leave you with that cold lonely hug-craving feeling only the best break-up albums can. the mood will draw you in and keep you listening but after a few listens it's the songs you'll fall in love with. ahh the songs. they're densely packed with chord changes odd but appealing lyrics and unexpected instrumentation. they're hooky without being obvious (a francine specialty). this was my favourite album of 2003 and i still listen to it pretty often these days. best tracks: this sunday's revival silver plated 606 novelty 13 years. best lyric: read a year old mail / now you should've told me / i've been repeating myself / only far less convincingly ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 adios marks the real goodbye from kmfdm. after they went on to do mdfmk which was decent and then they came back. attak was really weak because it was all sascha and skold and though i like them both the absence of gunter schulz and en esch really made this album absent in itself. wwiii though it is a better and pretty decent album kmfdm is still a little less present. adios gives us the remnants of what kmfdm fans know as kmfdm with skold present but not taking over completely (though i like skold but we need a break) we saw nina hagen lend her voice in witness which is amazing along with ogre from skinny puppy in that's all and full worm garden great tracks a little bit of pig and schulz's insane guitar riffs and you are all set. even though en esch was very minimal in the recording infact i barely remember him... currently working on fubar we'll see if kmfdm will impress again they have it still they are just not using their talents as of late c'mon sascha you're great man but get over yourself and get schulz and esch back... bring back kmfdm... what would skinny puppy be without cevin key? what would ohgr be without ogre? what would foetus be without thirlwell? c'mon man.. bring us back kmfdm... ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative

 i deeply love the music of joni mitchell. it is for this reason that i feel the need to warn you to dissuade you from being too early enthusiastic about this album aven before having heard it (as i stupidly did). the fact is that so many people spend so much energy in praising it (a new mature joni! a return to the roots! a brilliant acoustic album! and nonsense like these...) that it is very disappointing and frustrating to see (well hear) that joni has not changed from her foolish and useless music of the last 15 years (except dog eat dog which is superb but only from a lyrical point of view - musically it's an '80s disaster). it is the first joni mitchell album that i felt spleepy listening. ok some lyrics are quite good but nothing compares to the joni of the '60s and '70s. so i really do not get the point: it is so obvious to me that she has nothing left to say (how painful it is to face reality!) so why should all of you praise her? just because of what she did in the past? ok let us say that she was the greatest singer-songwriter of her generation (according to me much better than bob dylan) and let us praise her forever because of that; but i truly cannot accept that we still flatter her in everything she does even if what she does is boring and flat music pretending to be art. i would like to strongly dissuade you from buying this album (and anything else from 1982 up to now - except as i said dog eat dog). if you are still trying to introduce yourself through the divine music of joni mitchell try anything you want from the 60s and 70s. really anything. try to be open-minded and let her music flow through your veins. you have to be prepared for it could be beautifully dangerous: once you know her you will never let her go away from your soul ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 it's been a while since someone has sang the praises of this album. this is a timeless work. it never gets old no matter how many times it is played. i've had this album for 5-6 years and i pull it out every summer. great music for boating or bbq's on the deck. i promise you will love it. something everyone should have in their collection ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative
 i heard from a number of people that amon amarth were an excellent death metal band so with that in mind i though i'd try osftgh. what i hear and it certainly seems i'm missing out on something is sloppy musicianship and poor songwriting. just because you have mead dripping from your beard and you scream out lyrics that contain no mercy vengeance and it's your time to die does not mean you can create authentic viking/metal. these idiots could definitely take lessons from: enslaved manegarm falkenbach to name a few. don't fall for the hype! ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 bread8 that's one of the stupidest comments i've ever read. you don't know s*** about metal. you can't handle the intensity of real metal because you're a fat virgin who'd cry to your mommy if you heard godly metal songs like immortal rites and pleasure to kill. leave the metal to the metalheads you mallcore f@ggot. anyway dysfunction is better than staind's other stuff but only by a microscopic margin. aaron lewis is a weak talentless crybaby whose bandmates couldn't make a good song to save their lives. every song on here is full of bogus pain and depression coupled with abyssmal musicianship just like every other nu-metal band. if you want heavy music that's accessible for the masses go for rage against the machine (except for evil empire) faith no more helmet living colour and quicksand. ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative

 i was a huge fan of the jam but ive grown to despise paul weller and this cd strengthens my view. this is a covers cd and hasn't got a patch on albums like all mod cons or sound affects.with paul weller everything is about a quick buck and ripping off a loyal fan base with over a dozen jam compilations rarities box sets and dvd's in the last few years.[since he bought the exclussive rights to all the jam recordings from the rest of the band].this album is bland so give it a miss and spend your money on the new stiff little fingers cd which features bruce foxto ,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative
 i agree with everyone else; the music on this album is completely magical. two masters at work with a great rhythm section very spontaneous-sounding contrapuntal harmonies unbounded joy in every tune and some interesting arrangements. this is also the worst-sounding cd (or lp for that matter) that i have ever heard. it sounds worse than lo-res mp3s played over the web; i have recordings of 78s that sound better. i cannot believe that even laserlight would release this. i have other laserlight cds and none of them sound this bad. if they remastered this and made it sound better i would buy it again. that's the only reason for 4 stars rather than 5. still it's worth getting if you can listen past the horrible sound quality ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative

 i bought this cd after i'd watched the movie the first three times. the music is wonderful. i bought it specifically for the song they sing in the church scene - i don't care to stay here long and i want it played at my own funeral way out there in someday. you can't hear it without smiling and the words are much easier to understand on the cd than in the movie. but just in case here's the first foot-stompin' verse: fare -- well vain world! i'm going home. my savior smiles and bids me come and i don't care to stay here long. bright angels beckon me away to sing god's praise in endless day and i don't care to stay here long. right up yonder! christians away up yon-der. oh yes my lord for i don't care to stay here long ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 if you like late 60s british rock-psych tough-not-fey production/vibe white-soulful vox and mixing electric/acoustic elements (think: a cross among beatles + zombies + traffic + small faces even a lil' byrds feel occasionally) you shimply musht try rolled gold which compares to the cream of these groups' output!! -the ac-who-!? you might well say...'where have they been all our life?'; 'a gem beyond price has languished all these years unsavored' we repeat nearly speechless. not since our belated introductions to moondog...skip bifferty...billy nicholls...stones' metamorphosis...dantalian's vehicule... it can easily be yours. we very rarely care to replay any c.d. over and over but this one warrants such: well-crafted blend of nonchalance poetry and passion delicacy and yarbles hooks and chops and pacing and songs up there with the legends. the news that this cohesive album was only demo's* ('haps fortuitous in retrovision) catapults one's estimation higher still. singer reg king: on rolled's strength his visage deserves a spot on some rushmore-in-avalon alongside fellow soulful brits winwood/ marriott/ reid/ lloyd/ stewart...: just hoarse enough/just sweet enough (+ a 'secret': optimal use throughout of unison doubletracking)...perfection. rolled gold's production is on the raw/monoish/hotly-compressed side-- a flute/piano occasionally to augment the basic guitar quartet formula & keep things unexpected-- suiting the songs & performances to a tee (just to offer another clue to their magic brew). homey's in no way related to any bandmember.. ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive
 i prefer the live versions of these pieces. its nice to get more material from that period but you can hear the strain that was going on at the time of this final album by this line-up. i was at the concert for live record and think that they (the pieces that are on this cd) really come alive when being performed live ,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative
 hey folks this is brilliant and all like the articles say but what they don't mention is that it's impossible to listen to. there are no verses choruses or even beats to speak of. there are no songs. it's just a sound collage or something from start to finish. the booklet prints lyrics but i couldn't find 'em. this music is too brilliant for its own good. and you can forget about using it as party or background music. jdub's other offerings are much better ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 disappointing to see a man of garbarek's gifts drift inexorably towards artistic middle-age and the lure of mor classical and soft world-beat markets. no one expects him to do a 'jazz' album nowadays but after a six-year recording hiatus we might have expected some innovation and sharpness in the settings he chooses. sadlythe evidence on this release is of an artist who's content to mine the same musical territory for about 15 years now to the point of exhaustion; theres nothing here he hasn't said better on his previous three or four outings. all is not lost though and there are moments of stark beauty here and there but they are mostly lost in a soft sticky morass of garbarek cliches and the kind of uninspired composition better suited to a film soundtrack or tv documentary about some beautiful natural environment. forget the misleading hype elsewhere and get hold of just about any of his albums from about 1972 through to 1987 and i guarantee you'll feel better for it ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative

 no doubt about it from start to finish this is a classic for anybody's collection. i can remember back in the spring of '93 when the movie came out and it was a classic as well but the soundtrack matches up to what the movie was and this soundtrack sent a big message to a lot of us about what goes on the inner cities today. this was rap music at it's best from spice 1 to dj quik. there will not be a soundtrack like this ever again that addresses what goes on in our neighborhoods. so add this to your collection if you still love the true gangster rap west coast fan(like myself) or just want to hear a great soundtrack ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative

 of the dozen tracks featured here chances are the typical listener will only recognize four: &quot;signs&quot; &quot;sweet city woman&quot; &quot;one fine morning&quot; and &quot;gimme dat ding&quot; - and the last-named is out of sequence having come out more than a year before the others. the star of this show is lighthouse's &quot;one fine morning&quot; and rhino must be praised for offering up the full (lp) version rather than the 45-rpm edit which was about two minutes shorter. it's a shame in a way that this song had lyrics; had it been an instrumental it would have found a perfect and permanent home - on &quot;music from nfl films&quot; - it had that quality about it. as for the other eight offerings: if they wanted to pick some obscure stuff why didn't they go all the way and throw in dusk's &quot;treat me like a good piece of candy?&quot ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative
 the passion of the christ - songs is a fine collection of great songs each in their own way a reaction to the spectacular film that mel gibson has created. the standouts are the song i see love by steven curtis chapman third day an mercyme; scott stapp's powerful solo debut song relearn love; rainy day by big dismal and the emotional new again by brad paisley and sarah evans. despite a couple of songs that don't reach their true potential (the passion and how many lashes) this is a fine cd that belongs in anyone's and everyone's christian music collection. grade: a- ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative
 this is an awesome ep slayer owns all even when the production isn't that great. kerry king and jeff hanneman shred fast as hell with their blazing fast riffs tom araya's vocals are very hellish and gruesome and dave lombardo's drums are fast as well. this ep is slayer at their prime and even if it's only four songs it's well worth the price. below are my views on each song. chemical warfare 100000000000001/10 yes it is that awesome this is a legendary slayer song and a fan favorite. if you're gonna buy this for one song this is it the lyrics are great and i love the riffs in this track. captor of sin 10/10 the opening of the song is great. the song is really good too. my second favorite on this ep as well. haunting the chapel 7/10 i didn't really care for this song much it's good but not mind blowing. aggressive perfector 10/10 slayer's first song ever the opening sorta reminds me of metallica's hit the lights but the song is very different though. a part of this song sonds like the guitars are making video game like noises. the vocals are also a little different from other releases but it's still awesome. overall this ep was a great follow up to their debut. it also led to what the band would later become thrash legends. a must have for fans and general metal fans alike. highly reccomended ,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 leo kottke is a national treasure. he is our greatest living solo acoustic guitar virtuoso. having said that you'd expect his cds to be at a very high level of brilliance. i have at least a dozen of his titles. if there is any trouble in deciding the merits of any one disc it's because there are so many kottke releases to choose from. one guitar no vocals clearly ranks as one of the best. the compositions tickle my brain warm my heart and put a bounce into my step. the guitar playing is dazzling. you really get a glimpse of the man behind the guitar by listening to this music - brilliant thoughtful odd complex quirky a huge heart and the wackiest sense of humor. it's spirited music so thoroughly drenched in the personality of its creator that it's unmistakably and immediately recognizable as leo. the world is full of acoustic guitar instrumentalists these days. some of them are quite excellent. many are not. but there is only one leo kottke. and his guitar music is a gift to the world. a very strong recommendation for this cd ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative
 rob touches on so much with this cd. my favorite song is one that hasn't got any airplay and in my opinion the public missed out a great hit! streetcorner symphony is about people coming together. it's what i call my happy song. each day as i go to work i play the song as loud as i can get it! we my daughters and i saw him live and he also called it a happy song! i can't wait for his live albulm to come out! there are fast and slow songs on this cd and will be worth every penny you spend to buy it! incredible voice and songwritting ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative

 i received aerial last december and it still amazes me. the music soars and sweeps carrying the listener along on its wings. it is a work of genius and those who are long-time kate bush fans will find that it was well worth waiting twelve years for this masterpiece to arrive! this two-disc set offers the listener two different experiences in my opinion. the first disc a sea of honey is comprised of sort of stand alone pieces first of which is king of the mountain probably the most commercially appealing song on the album. king of the mountain sucks the listener in with deep murky tones and kate's voice easing into the song softly building in intensity as the song progresses. king of the mountain is followed by songs like pi (who else but kate bush could make the derivation of pi sound so sexy?) and bertie a lovely elizabethan paean to her young son. then there are emotionally raw songs like mrs. bartolozzi and a coral room the latter of which is about kate's late mother. the reclusive ms. bush teases the listener about the struggle for anonymity in how to be invisible and sings in reference to joan of arc in joanni. after being captivated by songs about famous people and more down-to-earth personal struggles/triumphs the listener comes to the second disc titled a sky of honey. this is in my opinion the pice de rsistance of aerial. this disc is a continuous journey of sound taking the listener on an amazing voyage punctuated by--among other things--the sounds of birds the sound of her child's voice and kate bush's silky voice singing in italian. the disc is almost indescribably beautiful in my opinion. i love the way a sky of honey takes me out of myself when i hear it. i feel like i am flying at points; becoming one with the soaring birds. my personal favorite on a sky of honey is nocturn a surreal nighttime romp on the beach accompanied by thumping bass and showcasing the pure magic of kate bush's voice. the disc's final (and title) track aerial is a forceful climax to the sonic journey and ends with bush singing: i want to be up on the roof i've gotta be up on the roof up up high on the roof up up on the roof in the sun it is as though kate bush has reached new heights and has taken the listener along for the trip. what an absolutely magnificent acheievement this disc is! to kate bush fans i cannot recommend this album highly enough. true it was a very long wait for this new cd but ms. bush has rewarded her fans duly; indeed it is almost like she released two separate albums at once with this two-disc triumph! if you are a kate bush devotee you will not be disappointed! and if you are new to kate bush aerial will be a great introduction to her genius. kate bush is like no other artist i can name. her voice is incredibly versatile; she can mold it to sound like an angel or a banshee a temptress or a child. and so far in her career it kate bush's voice gets better with the passing of time. like a fine wine one can savor it and contemplate its complexities endlessly. aerial is well well worth listening to and words alone cannot suffice to explain what a work of art it is. ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative

 hayley westenra at only 18 years old is an enchanting voice we should be hearing from for many years to come. this is an uplifting and at times spiritual album that shows shades of greatness. throughout westenra's voice is captivating though the musical scores are at times sub-par and do not equal the vocal talent. there was an advertising tag on this cd that stated the female josh grobin but i think a more accurate sentiment would be a young sarah brightman. odyssey is a fine mix of spiritual and operatic tunes all of which match up well with westenra's abilities. bocelli fans will also appreciate the duet dell amore non si sa. they pair up for that one song but the rest is all westenra. this is smooth soothing and easy listening. if you like brightman you will truly appreciate the voice of westenra. ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative
 although the real roots lie with the black artists who inspired these guys the pbbb is where the hippy generation(this is a couple years pre-san francisco and before the stones and beatles began stretching their arrangements out on record)learned to just play. their next record was more representative of what they were actually doing live at time time and is the single greatest influence on what became the san francisco sound of the late 60's and early 70's (really long and experimental jamming) so this is in fact the &quot;roots of the roots of the roots&quot; of todays jam bands and guitar-heavy blues bands mixed-race bands and for all practical purposes the white-blues-man in todays' world ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 jeff beck is the best guitarist on the planet and has been for a very long time. what you get here is an abbreviated version of him live. his song selection is not the best but freeway jam which is one of my all time favorite beck songs is included. you also ger scatterbrain and blue wind. she's a woman the old beatles song is also included. jeff beck at this time was playing some of his best guitar and his solo instrumental career was taking off. the songs with the jan hammer group to me are very average and infact distract what beck is trying to to. unfortunately this is his only live album from his instrumental era. i truely wish he would release a dvd of himself in concert for those who either havent seen him live or would like to see him live on dvd. the idea was good the cd is too short and not up to snuff ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 anyone who had access to a radio in the 80's would know at least two songs by missing persons. their fun music and amazing flare (dale did have pink and white stiped hair and it looked great!) make this a good party album. i also have their album color in your life and most of the songs are great. just as an added note warren cuccarullo is now a member of duran duran (my personal favorite band) and has been since he appeared on their notorious album which was released in 1986!! ,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative
 i pretty much agree with ej rupert but the good songs on this soundtrack are so strong that they make this album damn near classic all by themselves. i gave this album 4 stars for that very reason. though it was never released as a single my block is one of tupac's best songs (pre death row era is the best 'pac in my opinion). i don't think there's any question that every rap music fanatic recognizes red and meth's how high as an unquestionable classic (and this is the grimy version of how high....not the fluffy remix). i still get open to that beat 11 years later. though it is somewhat formulaic poppa luv it is still a dope cut from ll cool j. bone thugs n harmony mary j. blige and onyx contribute everyday thang everday it rains and live!! which show each artist in vintage form in my humble opinion. also sowhatyousayin' is the ideal west coast gangsta track in my mind. even when you get past those great tracks you have other bangers like kill dem all [kali ranks] glamour & glitz [a tribe called quest] and still can't fade it [warren g.] that still make for a great listening experience. hell even the dove shack blew up on the strength of summertime in the lbc. and the live version of biggie's me & my b*tch is definitely different from the studio version and it's great. there's plenty to love about this album. i also agree that there are too many filler tracks. what's up star ol' skool domino's in the house and zoom zooms & wam wam all fall under the filler category. actually the filler tracks are the only things wrong on this album and i'd say that only 10% of the album is filler. the rest is bangin'. the show soundtrack is definitely a worthwhile pick up for any hip hop fan. there are bangers on this album that make it a must own. if you were into hip hop around the time this came out you remember when half of these songs were played for the first time. there are definitely some classic tracks on this album. i highly recommend it. also for those of you that want more artists represented check out the rhyme & reason soundtrack (which is pretty much similar to this but with better collabos). you'll find a lot of artists there too. standout tracks: poppa luv it my block live!!! kill dem all summertime in the lbc how high (my favorite) everyday thang everyday it rains and me & my b*tch [live ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative

 it just amazes me what a joke the music industry has become. nowadays anyone can become a singer take for instance: ashlee simpson lindsay lohan and now paris hilton? lmao! no seriously though i'm still totally not sure how paris hilton became so famous. yes i know she's the hilton hotel heiress but i'm not sure why the media gives her so much attention. all she did was live off her family fortune but now thanks to that fortune she was able to get the right contacts to make her own record label called heiress records which is a sub-label of warner bros. after a reality show series modeling career a sex tape and a couple of roles in a few movies what did she think to herself? i think i want to be a singer now? apparently. and thats how this flaming pile of garbage came about. stars are blind is her first single off her debut album paris and let me tell you it's nothing new or original. the song has kind of a ska beat which i really don't think much of. her voice sounds like when you inhale helium from a balloon and the lyrics are mediocre. sorry paris but you failed miserably as a musician. leave this profession for the people that really have the talent ,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative
 i had reviewed the first edition of b'day and i personally called it business day because beyonc could not offer what we could expect from her especially after the highly acclaimed dangerously in love. actually in my opinion if ne-yo had not inserted irreplaceable in this project it could have been a bust. i agree dj-vu and beautiful liar were hits but i give the credit to the casting rather than the script. had these songs been given to india arie god knows what was gonna happen! how can she accept to put out such a poor album? some said beyonc views releasing albums in quick succession as a means of ejecting herself from her contractual obligations to sony columbia and team up with jay-z to form a new record label... but this cannot justify such an inconsistent and poor album. ne-yo confessed that the r&b genre is suffering from serious malaise. people just forgot what it was supposed to be what it was supposed to feel like the essence of what it is he says forcefully. it's a vibe it's a feeling -- it's supposed to make you feel something as opposed to `let me go eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh and put a beat behind it and see if people will dance to it.' come on man. there's more to it than that... ring the alarm from b'day falls in the same category. i read a reviewer who proclaimed b'day to be the best he's ever had and this is like saying george bush is the best president america has ever had... does this person know the beatles stevie wonder or aretha franklin? i suggest him to go back to the stores and get one of their albums and he will then be able to differentiate between music and marketing. i suggest the same reviewer to get albums called what's going on' (marvin gaye) purple rain (prince) the day (babyface) or even the recent let's get lifted (john legend). it is very sad to see artists (especially hip-hop) concentrating on making hits shooting sexy videos with the major target being going platinum and most of the time i find it better to buy the single and not the entire album since they all are full of fillers. what follows is that after a few months we completely trash their records. africa is the world's second-largest and second most-populous continent with 900 million people. maybe if the same guys had a purchasing power which exceeds latino market beyonc would be realising another edition in swahili which is the most widely spoken language in africa and she would be arguing she's had a great love for african culture ever since she was a child pretending she's coming back to the roots. anyway let's not be fooled by these music industry games their aim is to make money and this entails ignoring the basic artistic aspects. i agree bootylicious beyonce is the hottest lady in the music scene at the moment and none has denied her natural talent as a singer but she needs to refine her albums and give us s.th that can reach our soul. there are some female artists who are making good music without injecting too much cash in marketing to force sales: corrine bailey rae and heather headley ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 now on their sixth studio album (and second on a major label) carbon leaf plays it safe with the inoffensive rock/pop of love loss hope repeat. lead vocalist barry privett has a warm pleasant way of delivering his lyrics and renowned producer peter collins fulfills his duties. nevertheless the 11-song collection is most notable for its power of subtlety. in fact it is so subtle that not one song is memorable. some lyrics are heartfelt (the war was in color recounts a conversation between a grandfather and grandson lead single learn to fly regretfully summons up inner strength) but with such flat by-the-numbers melodies these songs have little to stand on. everything sounds just fine but nothing is endearing. every guitar strum and drum beat can be predicted ten seconds prior to its appearance and privett despite his appealing voice could easily be singing one extremely long song. this project is obviously well-intentioned but many other bands have done this before and better. these guys without a doubt have talent but this album will soon be forgotten for good reason. next time they will hopefully carve out a more unique sound than the one on this record. ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive

 studio album released in 1971 by the original band-a real band with alice cooper neal smith dennis dunaway michael bruce and glen buxton. i think the other band members (apart from cooper) got the short end of the stick. this album along with these 'love it to death' 'billion dollar babies' and 'love it to death' are so vastly superior to 'his' other albums. the band plays and writes really well together as a 'real' band. case in point listen to 'dada' from a few years later-dreadful! just wish he had kept a proper band together even if he fealt that they were not as musically good as some of the late session musicians. rock is about feel more than technique in my opinion. i can't even listen to 'dada' or ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive

 i have been listening to this album for at least 12 years and it rarely leaves my cd changer. i played the cassette version until it literally would not play any more and it was one of the first cds i bought. a relative first introduced me to this album and of course &quot;coming up close&quot; was the reason i bought my own copy. but i came to love each song and appreciate aimee mann as an exceptionally gifted songwriter. it is a great &quot;road trip&quot; album and &quot;on sunday&quot; makes the perfect &quot;summer song&quot;. the mix is not mainstream pop/rock. it is not a 1980's anthem but it is one of the defining moments for me. the lyrics have meaning which sometimes defies what the '80's were about. the only other thing i can say is listen to this cd! i am sure you will find mann's unique voice as captivating as i do. it is a definite must have for one's cd library ,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
 mountain music offers what alabama is famous for great music and great harmony all packaged together. the title cut is great that harmonica and &quot;old man of the mountain&quot; intro is unique. as for &quot;close enough to perfect&quot; if any man sings that song to his lady she is his forever. the cuteness of &quot;never be one&quot; also reminds us of the sadness that our children grow up so fast we hardly know it. there isn't a bad song on the whole cd and will make a good addition to any collection ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative
 i wanted to like brotherhood for the simple reason that nearly every new order fan this side of the galaxy has dismissed it usually with a faint whiff of snobbery (or at least apathy). turns out they were right: brotherhood is half an album. most of its nine songs feel unfinished as if the band wanted to cash in on the success of their 1985 smash low-life and didn't care about the end result. brotherhood is a rush job plain and simple but there are still glimmers of hope within this bare-bones effort. as it is when it was overcomes the album's overall muddy production by dint of being mostly acoustic and the melody is quite lovely. all day long the emotional centerpiece of the album by default is an intelligent (if half-hearted) protest against child abuse. while angel dust lacks a decent hook its subtly danceable beat and effective synth noodlings will at least briefly hold your interest. and the toss-off every little counts has a charming sense of humor that is too often lacking in new order's work. the most popular song on brotherhood is of course bizarre love triangle. so good it seems to belong to a different album entirely bizarre love triangle is truly new order's masterpiece. the solid beat slick sequencer work and gorgeous melody showcase the band at their best: catchy danceable and downright euphoric. (imagine how well it would have fit on low-life.) sadly the rest of brotherhood is unremarkable. the album's production neatly mixes rock with electronic flourishes which has become new order's signature sound but the songwriting doesn't measure up. buy the album if you're a trainspotter but casual new order fans would be better off picking up low-life or 1983's power corruption and lies. this one is just a footnote. ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive
 after carefully researching as many rain recordings as possible on amazon and reading all reviews i had hoped i had made a good choice with this cd. unfortunately i discovered that not only is the recording looped about every 60 seconds but there is an unmistakable low frequency rumble that is very apparent listening though my 5.1 system and my bose tri-port headphones. as a recording engineer i recognize this to most likely be a truck or car passing by and passing the sound up through the microphone stands that were obviously not de-coupled from the ground. the bottom line is i hear this rumble each and everytime i start to relax and it renders the cd completely useless to me. the recording is otherwise a good one and the stereo image presented seems authentic. since nobody else has complained of this rumble i will assume that it will only bother someone with a trained ear ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 it's always good to see an artist change and try new things. back in 2003 when jewel did it was a big deal. everyone accused her of selling out which i think is unfair. this disc while different is just not what i would call jewel at her best. i found america somewhat enjoyable and run 2 u was also but the rest of the cd did not sit well with me. i did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 cd goodbye and i must say it's jewel slowly regaining her musicality. also glad to here that she will be making a country cd next it will fit her voice well. ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative

 i have to tell you lionel hampton has yet to be matched in talent and drive on the phones. funny story it was tito puente the late and legendary king of the mambo was the one who showed lionel (by carefull persuation) the light of the phones and shuned him away from the piano. unfortunatly not much was known on this subject of the two meeting but i believe they meet in the service or right after tito was discharged for ww ii. i can tell you lionel to me is best know for his big version of flying home. a bigger badder version of the small groups version he did with benny goodman and teddy wilson. lionels closest match would have to be red narrvo form the 1930's but still mr. hampton 's drive and moves on the stage has yet to be matched ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 dave alvin's sublime new cd is a cadre of songs written by californians either born and/or who grew up in this land. the lyrics talk about what it means to live and love in the land of dreams and broken promises. it is also a look at the story of the frontier in this large western state. dave alvin has a voice that is deep and smooth and like a friend of his said infiltrates your brain like a shot of jack daniels. dave alvin says we started with a list of 25 songs from steve gillette to captain beefheart and everything in between. i was even thinking of doing 'going back to cali' as a blues thing. in the end though it wasn't about choosing my favorite songs so much as choosing songs that i could sing well enough and arrange differently enough to make them interesting. he has picked these songs carefully and each of them fit his style and voice well. of them all and i like each and every one my two favorite interpretations are here in california and surfer girl california bloodlines is a sentimental rendition of john stewart's fine work which finds peace in knowing there's california bloodlines in my heart / there's a california woman in my song ... and a california heartbeat in my soul. redneck friend the jackson brown less well known song was just right for dave alvin's style. kern river is a song merle haggard wrote after losing his best friend and it is a melancholy rendition. blind love from tom waits is sung in a bluesy style with some doo wops thrown in to give it style. here in california one of my favorites is sung with christy mcwilson. he felt this song needed a woman's perspective. i'm bewildered is an old richard berry the great guitarist's tune. backed up by the calvenes. sonora's death row written by blackie ferrell is a fable that examines the price of acting out of greed and anger and ends up a as gun fighter's tale. down on the riverbed is an old los lobos song that is sung in dave alvin's old blues style. between the cracks a song written by dave alvin and tom russell is a heartbreaking tale of young boy told by a loving woman with a rollicking tune. this is the only dave alvin orignal song in this cd. don't look now a song sung by john fogerty is an old creedence clearwater revival. bluesy and fun to make it dave's. tramps and hawkers by jim ringer is a delicate country waltz come dance with me bk. lyrics are wonderful. loser by jerry garcia and robert hunter is darker with more infused blues than garcia's version. it couldn't sound less like a deadhead song. dave alvin put in a psychedelic section that is a tribute to the san francisco sound surfer girl brian wilson's first song is done with doo-wops and again the calvanes did background. this is my favorite of dave alvin's interpretations and he sings this surfin'song with some tongue in cheek. dave alvin gives voices of california to this cd. voices from the california coastline and the surf music it inspired to the brown earth of the state to the frontier life and the lives won and lost. dave alvin had made his mark on this state and the writers who loved their lives by writing and singing about the state they love. play it often and pay attention to the subtle influence of this cd. california dreamin'? highly recommended. prisrob 6-04-06 ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 i can't believe the touch of b.b. king. i enjoy his playing immensely. i know this album gets buried in accolades. but i don't like it. the quality is poor and differing from other's opinions the crowd noise takes away from the music. b.b. said in so many words that live at the regal was far from his choice as his best recording. typically he said he wouldn't argue with success--and left it at that. there are so many good albums by b.b. you can't go wrong for $4.65 for the ultimate collection. sure it doesn't have them all--but it has quite a few of his great songs including a few from live at the regal. i would steer clear of this selection. or i'll send you mine for free ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 with perverse mike edwards set out to prove that jesus jones was more than a `sunny breezy pop band' what he ended up proving was that if they weren't no one was interested. sad to say but pop hooks were what people expected from jj and actually there are some here but they are smothered by industrial/techno gook. stick with doubt that's where jj peaked even if some claimed they had `sold out'. here they are pushing the boundaries but that doesn't always make for a great listening experience ,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative
 almost a classic in my book. we bumped this on the southside of chicago when this dropped. these two were like a west coast epmd because they blended perfectly. u could tell them apart easily because gangsta d had the eazy-e voice with the hard lyrics. while kk had a gruff voice and was a str8 clown. kk would say anything. once again the whole crew is on this one also: quik hi-c and amg. they had a tight click that just seemed to from voltron how they worked together. my favorites on this album are: if u want it be true 2 yourself let the rhythmand just ain't me (kk solo). i still take hoodrats on triple mmm shots.....listen to the album to find the meaning. hotep!! ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative

 there is a reason why styx was the first musical act to have 4 triple platinum albums in row! find out why. they are a unique band with their own uncatagorizable style and sound. not hard rock but can rock. not pop but catchy melodies and great three part harmony. not art rock but themed concepts in their writing and dramatic tempo changes and crescendos in their music. it is probably true that lady was the first power ballad though styx was not credited for it. lady paved the way for other rock bands to showcase their softer sides. perhaps styx was not always successful in their attempts but they took chances artistically and musically and should be given props for doing so. every song on this cd is great; however the two that stand out for me are too much time on my hands and suite madame blue. most people who have spent time in neighborhood bar will would likely agree that too much time on my hands is witty funny and true. suite madame blue a song which is a metaphor for the united states is simply one of the greatest rock songs ever!! the lyrics of suite madame blue are as powerful as the music and this song contains all the elements which made styx great ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive

 hermann baumann is one of the greatest horn players ever and he shows why he has been given that honor on this cd. i don't think that there is recording of the haydn concerto that even comes close to this masterful performance even better than tuckwell's. the cadenzas are absolutely awesome. i haven't listened to the rosetti before but baumann sounds excellent in this concerto as well. clevenger plays ok on the haydn but his articulation is a little sloppy. i'm a saxophone player but i can recognize true musicianship when i hear it and baumann certainly is a brilliant musician. highly recommended ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 fight club is without a doubt the greatest film i've ever seen. yeah i'm a fanboy. and what? and to make a great film flow you need great music right? well you need great music that fits the film and the dust brother's score more than does the trick. the film is dark yet satirical and it needed a score that would compliment that. however the score simply doesn't stand up on its own. at times in the film it perfectly enhances the dark atmosphere but its only a part of a tense scene. and hence it sounds rather empty by itself. no matter how much you like the film or thought the music sounded good in it (as i did) i wouldn't recommend it. like so many other scores it could have been made into great music but fails since its just lifted from the film ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative
 i bought this album when it was first released in the 70's. heaven and hell was hot item and passed through my senior school from ear to ear amongst 'those kids in the know' in much the same way that a joint would these days. the movements build on a theme throughout the work and reflect the care that went into creating some classical overtures. only later in life could i get the similarities to carl orf and khachaturian. this is a real masterpiece and a snapshot in time of when prog really was prog. listen to it in full and then catalogue alongside camel's 'the snow goose' the original 'tubular bells' by mike oldfield 'brain salad surgery' by elp and finally ' snowflakes are dancing' by tomita. please dont compare this work to the keybored pop i chose my spelling of the 1980's if you enjoy vangelis as i do you might also want to listen to the compositions of ennio morricone he is the man who wrote that great music that follows clint eastwood in the sergio leone spaghetti westerns. ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative

 i have to say i was getting worried that john adams was becoming a has-been. el nino's first half was much better than the second i didn't particularly like transmigration and i defy anyone to listen to his 2001 piano work american berserk and tell me it's any good. but after this release i stand humbly corrected -- he's still in my opinion america's if not the world's best living composer. dharma at big sur is scored for an electric violin and orchestra and uses a tuning system that's not well-tempered. what really makes this work special is the way the electric violinist plays soulfully and beautifully above the orchestra for almost the entire work in a sliding style i've never heard before in classical music. the first movement a new day with its quiet and contemplative opening really feels like it's the creation of an entire universe. the climax of the second movement might be the most satisfying conclusion to any of adams's works to date. dharma is an absolute masterpiece. my father knew charles ives is wonderful too even if it's not as powerful or moving as dharma. the work is both an homage to ives and a reflection of adams' life. clearly adams had a great childhood. the first movement concord is playful -- the clearest tribute to ives since it's sounds structurarlly similar to his fourth of july. the chaos in adams' concord is a little more rigid than ives' but it's still fun. the second movement the lake features a beautiful clarinet line that evokes the composer's father. the scurrying of the last movement the mountain seems needlessly frenetic at times but the cathartic ending that results of it makes the voyage worth it. my one bone to pick is with nonesuch. the two works together represent about 52 minutes worth of music -- an amount that many would already consider stingy on a single cd especially when other works like guide to strange places go unrecorded. so why put these two works on 2 cds? is it to justify the $20 sticker price? an artistic statement to completely separate the two works? it just seems silly. but it's also forming a nasty pattern of sub-30 minute cds that really should stop. people want to hear the astonishing sound world that adams creates -- why try to limit it to 25 minutes at a time? buy this disc even if it's split into 2 pieces. it's the best of his works yet ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative
 i have been listening to military band music for years and am rarely disappointed. however this compendium of music by the u.s. navy army and marine bands and associated choral groups is not to my taste. many of the arrangements are strange and there is much too much vocal music when what i want to hear is the bands play. i would not have bought this album hhad i known beforehand what i know now ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 as a contemporary of joan baez (age-wise) i loved her early music and the power of her incredible voice. i even empathize with much of her politics but unfortunately it's time she rested on her laurels. her voice on this cd is quite far removed from what she was once capable of and in fact i would have to say that there is no comparison between her vocal ability on bowery songs and her earlier quality. like some professional athletes she seems to not know when to quit... ,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative

 now i know what you're thinking why are there two releases of xx? well after they switched from eclipse to universal records they re-released the album xx but they also re-recorded all the songs with less hard core vocals (big mistake!) the original album is by far much better than the universal release in december of 2001. if you're not sure which one to go with go with this one! ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative

 eight years ago today was the day blondie's reunion album was released and though it was great to see blondie back together no exit just fell short on many levels. 2004's the curse of blondie(see my review also on amazon)is a much better album and should have been their comeback. no exit won't exactly take you back to the hooks that made blondie famous. harry's lyrics are wonderful in double take but the deadpan melody literally kills the song. fans were also not terribly waiting for jazz standards(boom boom in the zoom zoom room) or revamped demo tracks(out in the streets) but the worst cut is the title song that includes a rap verse by coolio. both the band and coolio could have thought of something more productive to sing about. the music isn't catchy either. all is not lost with songs like night wind sent and harry's own transformation in forgive and forget plus who would dare argue blondie's potential to shake the pop world again when you hear maria. as the album's best track maria is a wonderful reminder of how blondie and debbie can still create an infectious pop song that leaves a template on the mind ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative

 i saw her perform most of these songs on austin city limits. i must admit i hadn't paid much attention to her since her debut album back when i was playing in country bands. much of this material is kinda introspective but hey on the plus side you get great vocals well crafted songs tons of sincerity and just flat out integrity from this great artist who doesn't have to pretend she is anything she isn't. and these days that is pretty refreshing! i think i am becoming a fan ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 man can she get anymore stupid and talentless. she needs to spend some of that undeserved bling bling on some singing lessons than her skimpy outfits. all the songs on this album are totally unlistenable! she completely lacks power vocal range and versatility. jennifer lopez represents everything that is wrong with music today. she gets a recording contract because her good looks and success with her acting career. just because your a great actor/actress doesn't necessarily mean you can sing too. some actors/actresses were able to achieve it but not jennifer lopez. she needs to quit the music business while she still can. please stick to acting...oh wait! i forgot she can't do that either! ,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative

 bands from the 90s just sucked and nirvana fits in with that. they had a couple of ok songs and kurt cobain was some what talented but this is nothing to get excited about. i can not for the life of me see the things people see that just go off about how great they were. i don't see it. this is another cd in a long line of cds from the 90s that are a disgrace to music. ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative
 gene watson's music was introduced to me by a friend who played drums for sonny james ernest tubb and dottie west. i had never heard of him but then when i heard his voice on the cd i knew the songs. it's amazing to me how a person with such a great voice has never received the attention that he should. every song is great but the one which i really like is &quot;the old man and his horn&quot;. this was a song i had never heard. it also shows the versatility of gene's song selections. he has the best voice of any country singer i have ever heard ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 these guys were the nirvana of r&b motown soul black music in the 90s. as nirvana was the band that ended good white music. boyz to men was the band that ended good black music. i am kinda pissed because nobody seems to notice it like i do. these guys especially the lead singer would always sing oh wah oh wah oh oh ohhh oh after every sentence. i mean compare these guys to kool and the gang or the commodores or rick james. i could name tons and im not really a fan of soul type music. barry white whitney houston bobby brown the temptations isaac hayes luther vandross. i mean in the 90s i think almost every r&b group was better than boyz to girls. i dont understand why these guys are so popular. i guess its just like seinfeld it sucks bad but people like it. its like all these idiots were born yesterday forgetting about quality music and sitcoms from the past that were better. ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 think twice before purchase: 1. most of the good tracks are available on the non-copy protected all-time top 100 tv themes along with the best themes from other networks. 2. this disc has cds-100 copy protection so you probably can't upload to windows media and definitely not to itunes. i could not upload from my internal cd drive only from an external multi-format cd/dvd burner. it still only uploaded to windows media not itunes. to get into itunes i had to add the wma files and then convert them to mp3. this probably caused some quality loss as i'm converting one compressed format to another compressed format! a time-consuming and tedious process which could have been avoided altogether if music companies would get over this fixation on controlling everything. hello record execs: if nobody can add your discs to their libraries guess what happens? they don't play your music!!! you might think you're protecting your valuable investment but you're shooting yourself in the foot instead. here's how it goes: 1. nobody can upload your music. 2. nobody plays your music. 3. nobody hears your music. 4. nobody recommends your music. 5. nobody buys your music. remember this only loaded from a particular kind of drive so it may or may not work on yours. as bela lugosi would say: bevare ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 i am a 23 yr old mother of a 2 1/2 yr old. not only are these children horrible singers but there is a reason that most parents don't let their children listen to the original songs... they teach them things they don't need to know. i thought this would be a kids version that would get rid of that stuff when i let a child i was babysitting put the cd on... and was appalled at how much they talked about sex and other innappropriate things for children. they didn't take that out! children are exposed to that every day in our world now telling them it is normal and ok. parents have a big enough job to teach their children right and wrong with the way the world is today. it becomes a much harder job when you give them something that is for kids that teaches them that those things are normal. they assume if it is ok for a kids cd it can't be that bad. i think this is horrible and would never spend a penny on it for a child! some of the songs i like in the originial version and do listen to and this cd has ruined them! but when it comes to children who are too young to understand that it is just a song and doesn't mean what they say is ok... i think it is the worst thing you could buy for your child ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative
 this is a good compilation of afi's songs over the 10+ years they've been together. it's easily worthy of 10 stars. this cd allows newcomers to listen to the progress leading up to sing the sorrow and to get more intimate with the band. i havn't purchased this album yet because i already have all their albums but plan on it. the new tracks are from the answer that and very proud of ya era. they've finally been released on cd. this is a cool little feature fo newcomers also. anyway buy this album only if you havn't heard any of afis music but want to give it a try ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative
 we bought this - on cassette - in washington dc on our first day of honeymoon in september 1997. having flown from northern ireland it provided us with the perfect honeymoon soundtrack as we drove from washington to nashville along the skyline drive down through south west virginia across eastern kentucky to berea and down to smoky mountains national park in tennessee. we are from an ulster-scots/scotch-irish background and during those three weeks we fell in love with the land that our forebears had settled in so many centuries before bringing thier fiddles and folk songs with them creating what was the core of mountain old-time music and bluegrass. from the carter family right through every song is a classic. you must buy this ,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative
 it's sometimes hard to think there are really anymore pleasing melodies out there but thank halstead & co. for proving me wrong. i am happily pleased with their latest and very eagerly awaited effort. instead of the depths of melancholia and loveliness on say out of tune they give us 41+ minutes of what seems like basically it's good everything's going just way ok... it's happy. maybe i'll hear a lyric later that says something else but for those for whom music is the priority you can't go wrong with this considered and experienced and artful pop. four and a half stars ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative

 i read some of the other reviews before i submitted this. i don't see how someone could get upset over the liner notes. redd doesn't include danny gatton as an influence because he didn't listen to him. as far as other reviews concerning tone and the lack of fire well i don't even know how to address that. redd has one of the best tones i've heard on the tele and his note selection is what sets him apart from other pickers. ever hear of diarrhea of the guitar? well you won't get that on this cd because redd doesn't play something to just play it. this cd showcases redd's versatility from country to swing to blues to rock it has it all. if you like good pickin' then by this cd ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive
 it's sad that people can get a record deal for beinga good kareoke singer. yeah maybe my fish can get a record deal: they sing in tone can breath but refue to lip-synch(i know it sounds gay). this is just sad because bands that play their own instruments write their own songs and perform their own songs can pretty much get almost no attention. let's take the band king's x: doug pinnick (vocals/bass) is an amazing metal singer who can sing in perfect pitch and writes good lyrics about god (king's x is a christian band); ty tabor (guitar/vocals) has some of the bestguitar solos you probably don't know; and jerry gaskill (drums/vocals) has some pretty complicated rhythm patterns...yet only like a few dozen people (i know a lot more people than that like kx; i'm just exagerating) seem to like this band. it's sad. if you want good music listen to the band i just menioned (king's x if you weren't paying attention).

 ..of little teenage white girls trying to sound like thirty-year-old black women. first it was britney spears then it was christina aguilera now it's joss stone. the former at least have something going for them; britney's first album had catchy beats and even though aguilera's style is incredibly trashy she does have enormous vocal power and range if she would only stop trying so hard. try as i might though i just don't understand the appeal of joss stone. i didn't buy this album; a friend of mine likes it and i've had to listen to it enough times to want to rip my ears right out of my head. i don't see what is fresh or original about ripping off janis joplin and the generally much more talented black soul singers. maybe it's the rick astley effect: you don't expect that voice coming out of that face. you don't expect a squinty little teenaged blonde to growl and screech like a deranged cat. but that effect can only take you so far as rick astley himself found out. this album is not only an unpleasant listening experience because of the stupid songs (dirty man basically just repeats you're a dirty man... with very minor variations along with a great deal of unnecessary caterwauling) and the nails-down-a-chalkboard voice of stone herself - it's a depressing reminder of how low our culture has sunk when it can't come up with any culture based on its own heritage but slavishly copycats things from another culture that seems more cool. stone like aguilera and spears tries to sing like an older black woman a woman with soul - an aretha franklin or a gloria gaynor. but stone et al. sound like little girls clattering around in grown-up shoes. they haven't been alive long enough to live similar experiences of the women they are trying to imitate. their singing rings hollow to me show-offy and fake. stone could rival aguilera in shameless and unnecessary vocal theatrics though she has nowhere near aguilera's sweetness or range. her voice might be described as smoky by some; to me it sounds gravelly sandpapery and as pleasant as scraping your knees on asphalt. i don't understand why anyone in the right mind would willingly put themselves through the ordeal of listening to this cd much less enjoy it. i guess fake is good enough for some people. it makes me chuckle though to hear people rave about her voice as authentic. if you're looking for soul try macy gray. she's for real. try the hugely talented but woefully ignored tasmin archer and karen rodriguez. those are fresh authentic voices that will make you realize what a load of bollocks joss stone and her ilk truly are. the only white woman i have ever heard who could sing like she was black was linda ronstadt. go back and listen to a ronstadt classic like hurts so bad and compare it to this modern-day drivel. ronstadt sang with real feeling real knowledge real pain - worlds apart from this fake plastic imitation of soul that seems to be the rule and not the exception these days. i gave this one star because there is no zero-stars option. joss stone is just a musical chav an unconvincing shoplifter of another better culture ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 as we all know by now lil' jon is not known for his lyrical capabilities but for his platinum productions and ability to find guest artists perfect for his songs. he is truly the king of crunk. many of the songs on the album are much like the hit single get low feat. the ying yang twins- strong pumping dacefloor beats lots of swearing and yelling constantly yeeah! whuut? and okaay! buying the edited version (if there is one) would be a total waste. this album is not for the meek or faint hearted! much of the songs hardly have many words from lil jon himself mostly from the featured artists. these include petey pablo 8ball and mjg chyna whyte pastor troy jadakiss styles p. ect. my faveorites 1) throw it up w/ pastor troy- a 'hood representing song with a thumping beat 2) get low 3) rep yo city w/ petey pablo bun b- a very good song with talents all around 4) knockin' heads off- again jon struts his stuff 5) i don't give a...- perfect for before game pumping musi ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative
 with all the 'neuvo flamenco' and its accompaning popularity. it is nice (and a relief) i might add to hear the flamenco guitar in its purist form. not only does this cd contain sabicas and nino ricardo. it also contains four very rare perfomances by manolo de huelva. which are difficult to find anywhere. also included are melchor de marchena performing six pieces. this is truly pure flamenco at its best ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative

 before i review this classic rolling stones album i just want to point out that juke box hero and whirligig are one in the same person. a troll who likes to trash great music and praise dire straits(who are a good band but nit the greatest) and green day. i say cut the shenanigans! now that is off my chest back to the review! the rolling stones' second album to be released on their own label fittingly called rolling stones records which was distributed by atlantic at the time(now virgin/capitol) entitled exile on main street was released in may of 1972. the album was the band's only double studio album but is one of rock's greatest double studio albums in history and ranks up there with other classic 2-record sets like the wall quadrophenia the lamb lies down on broadway and tommy among others. before guitarist keith richards' heroin addiction took over for some time in the mid-1970s he was what the late producer jimmy miller called a workhorse. the album was recorded at keith's home in france and at olympic studios in london and muscle shoals in alabama and in los angeles. keith's music and frontman mick jagger's lyric writing was arguably at its peak on exile on main street. songs like the opening rocker rocks off the 50s sounding rocker rip this joint the album's hit tumbling dice the country-ish sweet virginia keith's classic rocker happy(and it is his most famous track which he sang) the slow-ish soul survivor the fast-paced blues rocker all down the line and the soul sounding shine a light are classics which sound like they could have been recorded yesterday. ventilator blues was another highlight as it was the only song that mick and keith wrote was co-written by guitarist mick taylor whom just tore the place up from 1969-74(his solos just rocked from 1969-74). exile on main street was the rolling stones' second consecutive #1 album and another million seller. the tour in support of the album saw the band getting bigger and bigger. almost 35 years on this album is still a classic! this album is hugely recommended ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive
 my youngest brother who has a pretty strange sense of humor bought me this cd for my birthday; i wonder how he knew i didn't own it already? i don't even know where to begin with this one. what can you say about somebody who poses for an album cover in rainbow-painted panties while licking a heart-shaped lolli-pop? and the foldout poster of her reclining on pink satin sheets with said lolli-pop is downright laughable. does she expect anyone to take her seriously? after her first album i thought carey had a remarkable talent that needed some fine-tuning particularly in regard to her penchant for singing cliches. instead of getting better though she has turned her career into a self-debasing fantasy of baby-doll mannerisms coupled with relentlessly monotonous song choices. rappers like jay-z snoop dogg missy elliott and usher are brought in to add spice but they only drown in the sticky-sweet syrup of gunk that she chooses to sing. she may have a lot of #1 hits but who can tell any of them apart? rainbow is only carey's latest entry in a career that has lowered the quality standard for divas everywhere. d- tom rya ,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative

 nightrage - descent into chaos - thomas lindberg's latest offering to the music community is the swedish and greek mix called nightrage. this album actually being my first offering to the band i was unsure what to expect. like most i am a big fan of atg and lindberg's harsh vocal styles.... nightrage however came as a pleasant surprise. (as in it wasn't yet another atg clone) they seem to have more melody than thrash but definitely embody aspects of both genres.... the haunted where the former atg guitar players are now located seemed have gone with more thrash then melody. (which is odd since they actually have atg's guitar players?) anyway enough comparisons! nightrage is really decent for a newer band in an over saturated scene... amazing guitar work and one of the genres best vocalist makes this cd well worth a couple of listens. also i've only given this album 2 spins at the current time and stuff like this usually grows on repeated listens. favorite songs: being nothing phantasma omen and descent into chaos. -4 stars if you liked agreed or appreciated this please click yes for: was this review helpful? ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative

 i liked this when it first came out b/c i was 16. i was a rebel wanted to be part of something different. this is their best work since the weirdness does get lame after a while. favorite song is mongoloid...totally strange but rocking song. uncontrollable urge rocks (in a weird way) and come back johnny is almost a conventional song. satisfaction is completely unique but its not a good song. the group was obviously trying to do more than music and develop a kiss multi media making money kind of thing. i saw them live (they were horrible) during their hey day. the most interesting thing about them is while other odd bands were eventually accepted and integrated into the mainstream devo is still as odd of a group as ever. mark motherbough does a lot of soundtrack work (rugrats) and you can hear the devo in all of his work. anybody that gives this novelty group 5 stars is cheapening what true excellent music is. devo came out as a goof not as serious musicians. they got big in the 70's b/c they were part of the new wave and kids (like me) were looking for alternative music that we can claim our own. ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive
 as he did with parade the soundtrack to his last vanity project under the cherry moon prince provides a musically invigorating soundtrack to graffiti bridge which is a hopelessly silly film. no matter. graffiti bridge prince's first album of the 90's is also one of prince's best albums of the 90's. new power generation serves as the title track to prince's new band and it's a powerful funky manifesto. the question of u is exotic and intoxicating. elephants and flowers is an upbeat song about spiritual redemption whereas tick tick bang is prince at his most joyously raunchy. although most of prince's material is exceptionally strong here the collaborations and contributions by other artists are a mixed bag. we can funk is a simmering duet between prince and funkmaster george clinton and tevin campbell provides some youthful exuberance to round and round. but the tracks by the time mostly fall flat. i've personally always found morris day to be a one-trick pony with his effete pimp routine and his one trick gets boring quickly. it's obvious that with graffiti bridge prince is trying to create the feel and atmosphere of a funky block party. but i can't help but wonder without the tracks featuring other artists if graffiti bridge wouldn't be more highly regarded as one of prince's better albums ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 i bought this cd because i figured it would be a fresh take on some old favoirites. well i'd like to say i loved it but i didnt. this cd just comes off as flat and lifeless. where as the original songs the kyle toucher on vocals versions had a certain edge the remakes make great material sound very mediocre. for those of you first discovering dr. knowl this may be the greatest cd in the world...the material is that good-but if you really want to experience dr. know buy their best of cd that was released on mystic records. this is the best version of dr. know. hope this helps ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative
 from the manic whirlwind prelude to the shocking cake and sodomy portrait of an american family is an album that stands on its own two feet as being catchy and memorable. cake and sodomy dishes out the obscene gestures lunchbox is told with a twist of humor organ grinder is pleasing vocally cyclops is addictingly wild get your gunn is catchy (if not overly insulting) dope hat is great and fierce and my monkey is hysterically enjoyable. snake eyes and sissies is another winner easy to get lost in. the rest all work to varying degrees though not as appealing. every song on this album is worth listening to from fast paced and rock style to techno overload. ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive,positive
 i am a latecomer to the works of chopin unqualified to comment on dinu lipatti's technique and interpretation but this recording gives an interesting framework to explore the waltzes. they are numbered 1 through 14 in order of opus publication but on this disc lipatti shuffles them to form a cycle of his own devising. there are four waltzes in the key of a flat and it seems one challenge was to space them across the recital. contrast this to alexandre thaurad's cd where he clumps like-key waltzes into groups. (he also adds five more posthumous works.) most of chopin's waltzes start on the dominant meaning either the fifth note of the home key (the tonic the i) or a dominant seventh chord (v7) which leads to the tonic. lipatti uses this feature to string together his cycle. if for instance there were a waltz that ended on a c natural it could easily bring us to waltz no 4 which starts on an insistent c7 chord before rising to the home key of f major. i will use this as the starting point for tracing the harmonic relationships of the tracks on this cd. track 1: waltz no 4 in f grande valse brillante - as noted starts on the v7 and finishes on f in octaves. track 2: no 5 in a flat - begins on a trilling dominant eb but the note it trills up to is an f (which ended the previous track). finishes with a parting shot a turn in the bass ending on ab. track 3: no 6 in d flat minute waltz - starts on ab; the contour of the opening phrase echoes the gesture of the previous parting shot as well. ends in db. track 4: no 9 in a flat - has two pick up notes then hits a db on the downbeat of the first measure. the right hand ends on the ab above middle c. track 5: no 7 in c sharp minor - starts on a g sharp above middle c which is the same black key (enharmonic equivalent) of the previous ab. ends in c# minor. track 6: no 11 in g flat - starts with a pick-up turn then hits the downbeat with a db (enharmonic c#). ends on a gb in the treble clef. track 7: no 10 in b minor - starts quietly on the same note an f# (enharmonic gb). ends with a soft b in the bass clef. track 8: no 14 in e minor - first note is the exact same b in the bass. ends in e minor. track 9: no 3 in a minor - starts on an e in the bass melody. ends in a minor; keep in mind that minor third of this key is a c natural -- you can hear it in the melody of the third to last measure. track 10: no 8 in a flat - this is a side-stepping change of keys but there is an harmonic link to the previous waltz. instead of starting on the dominant this one begins on the major third -- c natural. track 11: no 12 in f minor - starts on the dominant -- c again. toggle back and forth between tracks 10 and 11 and you will hear that these two waltzes start on the exact same pitch. instead of ending in f minor this waltz closes in the relative major of ab. the last three notes are a rise and fall bb-c-ab. track 12: no 13 in d flat - there is a leading note before the dominant. the first three notes (bb-ab-f) fall and rise in a mirroring gesture to the final phrase of the previous. ends quietly in db. track 13: no 1 in e flat valse brillante - another side-stepping key change but there is a connection. if you toggle between tracks 12 and 13 you will hear the same initial note a bb -- quietly in the former boldly here. finishes resoundingly in the tonic eb. track 14: no 2 in a flat grande valse brillante - introduction in the dominant chord eb7. closes in ab. from here you could loop around to the beginning of the cycle again linking the major third (c natural) to the v7 that starts the f major waltz ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative

 once again the geniuses at universal have failed to give fans a decent collection! although the single disc very best of released in 2005 provided a fine and simplistic overview of robert palmer's career it omitted a few must have songs in favour of live material (making for a 90% ok collection). earlier anthologies also suffered invariably from redo syndrome: the artist redoing a vocal track here a drum mix there re-recording entire songs elsewhere. this collection's no different. in fact there are many remixed and redone and alternate vocal mixes present (something the very best of album avoided altogether much to its credit). here insult is further added to injury with poor song sequencing. indeed the classic and sequenced sailing shoes/hey julia/sneaking sally through the alley trilogy that marked the beginning of palmer's breakthrough album is present but the songs have been scattered apart from one another. thereby pondering the question: what were they thinking? why was this done in this manner? what do fans really want? a 2 disc set that features the original material (remastered yes but not remixed in any way shape or form) and a proper chronological sequence. done in this manner such a set would properly honour one of popdom's most memorable and talented individuals. what gold has done showed that compilers went through a rock encyclopedia took the right batch of songs but mish-mashed them in a half-cobbled manner. this collection does no one any favours. stick to very best of until another bright light at universal tries their hand at compiling a decent collection. that said the way the music biz is these days don't count on it. ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive

 i would have to say that out of the countless bands i have heard over the past few years into eternity is one of the best and has one solid album here!! i think they have something a lot of bands do not have and the one cool thing about them is tim roth seems to give a real crud about his fans as he does guitar videos on his website to show you how you can break down his guitar riffs and that to me as a guitarist is so helpful (ive learned some of their songs this way) and this shows how he is not afraid to be the nicest guy and actually take that kind of time to be close and original to his fans.you just never see that these days. and the rest of this band has so much talent stu can scream like halford growl too and has a high vocal range and it makes them sound interesting. plus jims drum work how can anyone say this dude isnt one of the better drummers he is so tight but can slow it down and tempo change very well. this album plain rocks it should be known as these guys were on gigantour and rocked there too. be cool if them and annihilator went on tour. i have become very fond of them and hope they stick around and keep making great albums in a world overflowing with the same ole un-original bands that all sound the same! ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

 i bought kayslays pain from the game about a week before it came out in most stores(my local cd store likes to sell their copies ahead of schedule;). i read that it featured production by swizz beatz kanye west eminem and the heatmakerz. and as far as rappers go most of the shady/aftermath camp is on here somewhere along with a ton of other big artists (fat joe ghostface killah raekwon scarface memphis bleek and prodigy etc). so i expected this cd to be a big step up from the streetsweeper volume 1 mixtape (which i would give 3 stars at best). but for all the talent on this cd there's not many good songs. i thought the production was pretty weak. some no name guy produced most of the cd but even the kanye west swizz beatz and eminem tracks are pretty bland. if you have to have every song your favorite rapper or producer ever made grab this disc. if your looking for good music leave this one alone ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 i purchased this cd shortly after finding out that nickel creek would be disolving their union as a band. i hoped that this collection would be suitable for both myself (as a strong supporter of nickel creek) and my two children. this cd honestly fails to deliver a suitable substitution for the music that nickel creek produced over the past 7 years. although i guess that was an unrealistic expectation to have for this cd. you have to keep in mind that the members of nickel creek were just children themselves when they released this cd. i don't believe that they had found their true musical identity and they obviously wouldn't have reached their full musical potential yet. this cd isn't really the best for a todler either so i have to say that this purchase was a let down overall ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 i can't fathom why anyone would enjoy this album. the lyrics must have come out of a dadaist poetry circle and (most of) the guitar work is completely without personality. what is the criterion of a good rock album? by any standards it must be a joy to play it. 6teen stone misses the mark by such dimensions one must assume it was intentional. but it doesn't so much incite anger than it does disdain for bush's attempts to emulate nirvana. where nirvana has clearly enunciated guitar riffs and minimalist evocative lyrics bush has dull throbbing guitar drones that project nothing to the listener but a kind of malaise-inspired anger. there's not much more to say about 6teen stone. i could tell you about the embarrassment of listening to the lyrics on songs like swim: thinning ice / 14 hairdryers / swimming to you / flame on earth desire. or the artistic suicide of the last track x-girlfriend a song composed of a little guitar-wailing and a non-stop chorus that's about six words long. that's about all i can tell you. mostly i figure i've done enough warning to let you make your own choice. if you do attempt this though you ought to be told the little good news that there is: there are about 5 minutes of good music are contained on the album split between machinehead and glycerine. the first is an energetic well-constructed song about control (you might have seen the music video for it about 11 years ago on total request live) the second a serenade featuring over-dubbed guitars a trembling cello and a surprisingly coherent rossdale. they hold the album; about as well as a couple of floor joists can hold a crumbling building. ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive

 this live album/in-studio acoustic ep is hard to figure. most of the live stuff is selected from bls's &quot;stronger than death&quot; album which wasn't all that great to begin with. the only good thing being; that album was so poorly mixed that live versions of &quot;all for you&quot; and &quot;13 years of grief&quot; sound much better and immediate than their studio counterparts. a new heavier version of &quot;no more tears&quot; tries to please but fails by showing zakk wylde's gruff vocals don't always work. unexpectedly the bonus acoustic ep is the far better attraction. &quot;like a bird&quot; is the best song neil young never wrote and &quot;blood in the well&quot; shows zakk's soloing chops in full form. bls needed some better songs before doing a live record. end of story ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 this was the break through record for pink floyd that would place them in the super-league. the strength of the record lies in the song writing that is simple yet engaging and dave gilmore's guitar playing and voice is superb. production wise this is well polished and the presence of the sax and backing vocalists just give it that little extra commercial potential. overall the record works well as a whole yet i do feel 'money' seems out of place. the problem with records like this that it is too easy to enjoy and all the sharp ends are neatly filed off and well packaged for your consumption. now don't get me wrong i think this is a magnificent record but is it really pink floyd's greatest album i tend to think not. is it the greatest record of all time? most certainly not. because a records sells 35 million copies does not make it automatically great. because everybody and their grandmother thinks it's great does not necessarily make it great. the problem with this record is that it sounds of its time not that that's a bad thing its just that it does not transcend time. the real indication of a great record is how many people it inspires to make records that sound like it. i can't think of many records that sound like this without sounding retrogressive. some records released at the same time: can's future days(1973); nue!'s 2(1973); king crimson's larks' tongues in aspic(1973); robert wyatt's rock bottom(1974); tangerine dream's phaedra(1974) are by far more influential and enduring than dark side. if you don't own dark side then buy it because it is a very good record and deserves its five stars but make sure you buy 'piper at the gates of dawn' also. 'piper' is floyds greatest most influential and definitely one of the greatest of all time. besides how many people who think 'dark side' is floyd's best have actually heard 'piper'. ,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive

 in the classic and disturbing 1972 movie deliverance lewis (burt reynolds) gives this ominous warning to ed (jon voigt): machines are going to fail. systems are going to fail. then... survival. what i wonder will richard d. james (a.k.a. aphex twin a.k.a. afx) do when the machines fail? it's been nearly five years since his underappreciated album drukqs where we got a tantalizing possible answer to this question: the plaintive lovely satie-esque acoustic keyboard nocturnes intermingled among the abstract frantic electronic soundscapes throughout its sprawling duration. [another intriguing solution was proposed on the album acoustica: alarm will sound performs aphex twin...] chosen lords rdj's first proper cd release since then is actually a collection of various tracks from his analord series of overpriced elaborately packaged 12-inch vinyl singles that he's been cranking out over the last year or so. those who were put off by the excesses and overt eccentricity of drukqs may hail these cryptically titled drum-machine laden compositions as a return to greatness. indeed afx is certainly reviving a more compact accessible (for him) and straightforward style here with comparatively regular (though not quite danceable) rhythms and those comforting underlying simple synthesizer melodies. i have to say though that there's a disappointing and somewhat melancholy sense here of a great musical mind spinning its wheels. by returning to such familiar ground he seems to be setting up systems and letting them run their course in an almost cynical way without any of the maniacal glee that was once part of his singular musical personality on unforgettable releases like come to daddy windowlicker the richard d. james album and yes -- drukqs. notably lacking are the voices that once regularly appeared in his productions -- true they were usually rather unsettling distorted and manipulated voices but at least they added some welcome humanity. also missing are those rare but beautiful moments of repose (ballads?) such as flim nannou and the striking piano interludes on drukqs. in the end chosen lords while an undeniably interesting and expertly produced collection of electronic music is nonetheless a sterile static joyless affair. if it inspires any emotion at all it will probably be pity and sadness as you listen to a possible musical genius coasting along without exploring any new directions for the first time in his otherwise remarkable career. yes i'm afraid the machines have failed richard d. james and i sincerely hope he can survive in this cold and remote musical wilderness of his own creation.. ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative

 first off i'd like to say that i am not a country music fan but i am a johnny cash fan. he transcends the genre that turned his back on him in his later years but here the man can do no wrong. now i bought the 2000 expansion release of this concert which at the time was dubbed the complete concert recording. it was misleading because i had seen the british documentary (the dvd of this is included in the set)in which johnny & friends were performing songs i never knew existed from this legendary event because they were absent on cd. now this is the full sha-bang complete with amazing packaging the concert spread over two cds and the dvd mentioned above. if you bought the previous cd like i did let me tell you this is worth the upgrade as it seems this is the definitive end to all release of johnny singing to the boys at san quentin. for new fans the single cd release might be the best place to start since it has at least 85% of what johnny sang that night at san quentin. the rest of the legacy tracks feature the carter family carl perkins and the statler bros. so if you're looking for a johnny cash solo concert then get the single cd version. if you want the absolute complete version in a great package 40 page booklet and he legendary british documentary of this concert for the first time on dvd; the legacy edition of this memorable night is the way to go ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative

 hmm... ok maybe it was not the best reason to want to buy this cd but i heard one of the songs on it hashkiveynu performed (partially) during an episode of the west wing and it sounded amazing (it was not the same cantor as on this cd). i am not jewish and not even very spiritual but i wanted to have that song in my collection. i immediately searched the web for the info got the name of the chant and found this cd. i almost purchased it without listening when i found a different site where they actually have rather long excerpts (2 min.) of most tracks so i listened to them. boy was i relieved and disappointed at once! relieved that i didn't buy the cd and disappointed that i couldn't get the song i wanted (i was willing to buy a whole cd for just 1 song that's how much it impressed me). the song sounds very little like the one from the west wing although i do believe that the site where i found the info speficially pointed to this cd as having a recording of the same song used in the show. and i'm sorry to say it but the voice also doesn't hold a candle to the one used on the show - way too operatic as mentioned by many and harsh and even unpleasant-sounding to me. it took all the charm and candor right out of the song (in the show they had a much more natural voice do the song). i also agree that the choir does not mesh well with the soloist. if anyone knows where and if i can purchase a recording of this song done by a different singer (if it can be the one from the west wing i'll be thrilled) please let me know. in the meantime i'm passing on this cd.. ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 modern dub stylings from an assortment of recording artists ranging from the bizarre and brilliant (check the lost scrolls of hamarik's darkly deranged how to find royal jelly) to the utterly unforgiveable (namely luciano's appaling attempt at police &amp; thieves). luckily for us most of the tunes here fall into or around the former category with great contributions from st. germain (bouncing dub-disco on a dub experience) grant phabao (updated roots righteousness on andub head yudu) and boozoo bajou (with the wonderfully cheesey divers). and let's not overlook cottonbelly's 90's classic tempest dub which resurrects an old scientist tune to spine-tingling effect. only the fairly plain seven dub and the aforementioned luciano really fail to ignite...all in all then a worthwhile collection which works very nicely as a whole - providing you program the cd player to skip the occassional duffer ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 this disc dates from monk's early period before he achieved recognition and started to descend into a long series of formulaic recordings for columbia. so it's valuable from that point of view. it's also a wonderful chance to hear him showcased without horns although the standard is perhaps not quite as high as the trio blue note recordings that immediately preceded it. the best tracks both from a musical and recording quality view point are an extended blue monk which many consider the definitive version and a lovely unaccompanied just a gigolo which anticipates later solo masterpieces such as alone in san francisco. sweet and lovely is in a similarly reflective vein. much of the rest of the album has a forceful driving quality with aggressive use of dissonance in places - even for monk. a particular highlight is monk tearing through these foolish things ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative
 herb alpert has done what few artists can do. he's taken his seminal masterwork and transformed it into another entity that is equal to or may even surpass the original. i love the original whipped cream but this cd is a masterstroke. combining alpert's traditionally peppy music with downbeat electronica transforms it into a soothing but never boring mix that continues to enchant the listener from beginning to end. unlike some of the purists i loved this cd and you will too ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative

 it would be easy to say that this is the single greatest performance of the mahler eighth ever recorded; i believe it is. but it would be difficult to say that and have it mean something because after experiencing this colossal achievement the competition (including alphabetically abbado bernstein chailly haitink horenstein kubelik nagano olson [colorado mahlerfest] solti and tennstedt among others) suddenly seemed far less impressive than they once had. what sets this mahler eighth so far apart from virtually every other is its sense of ecstasy; of a transcendent vision being communicated of a religious fervor. mahler had an extraordinary plan in putting together what he considered his most important work such that he could bring us to the brink and say there. it's out there. you can't see it but you can divine it (and call it what you will: god or love or some all-embracing power outside of ourselves). most performances miss the mark then in one of two ways: by remaining resolutely earthbound or by trying to capture that vision in terms we can understand. the problem of course is that if we can understand it it's no longer a vision it's something mundane. in the closing pages of wit's extraordinary (and that word as well as any other hardly begins to do it justice) performance you become aware of that vision existing just beyond your comprehension. you know it's there only because you're willing to take that leap of faith. and that's what i mean when i say he brings the piece a sense of religious fervor. there is nothing dogmatic about the kind of religion i'm referring to here. so let's look at the basic components of the performance element by element: the sound: spectacularly natural and all-encompassing. the soloists emerge from the overall sonic image like members of the orchestra and the chorus orchestra and organ blend to perfection. the soloists: to a letter the finest group i have ever heard. there's a distinctly slavic sound that seems altogether appropriate given mahler's bohemian roots and a refreshing lack of self-importance. no operatic grandstanding here. and for the first time ever i felt as though i was missing something by not following the words (no libretto is provided though it is available online and can be found easily enough elsewhere) because everyone sounded like they cared dearly about what they were singing. they weren't going through the motions making pretty sounds. they had something imperative to communicate and wanted us to know it. to be honest part ii has often bored me to tears (with chailly's performance being particularly offensive in this regard) but here i was literally on the edge of my seat throughout impatient to hear what (and who) came next. and throughout it all so importantly there was a sense of spiritual ascent from beginning to end. the choruses: easily the best i've ever heard. the way they rip into hostem repellas longius with their shrieks in the great double fugue of part i is unforgettable and the fugue itself which has never reminded me more of the rabble section from the first movement of mahler's third literally had my spine tingling throughout its entire course. that's nothing. i got chills right at the beginning of the chorus mysticus and six and a half minutes later they had not abated! i have never experienced anything like that before. ever. and i don't just mean while listening to music. the conductor: what can i say? he holds the symphony together with a tautness and logic that nobody ever credited this work with having before. how? i have no idea but when the start of part ii doesn't jar as it usually does you know you're in for something special. maybe it's because the orchestral prelude there seems faster than usual or because he finds so much inwardness in the first part (the first entry of the soloists for instance is so raptly caressing). the orchestra: while they don't have the mahler sound that the concertgebouw or vienna philharmonic may produce there's an earthiness (but never sloppiness) that sets them far apart from the bleached sterile sound of too many american orchestras that make mahler sound not like mahler. to sum up then i could not speak for an hour after hearing this recording and still burst into tears at the mere thought of it especially those radiant visionary and extraordinary closing pages. record of the year; record of the century! it crowns not merely my mahler collection but an entire lifetime of listening to great music. ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative

 a lot of people seem to snub their noses at let's talk about love because it wasn't the career-defining album as the album that preceded it but all in all it's still a fantastic snapshot for celine's career in 1997. celine shocked almost everyone by releasing a follow-up so shortly (falling into you was still in the top 40 on the charts at the time) but it was very worthy. among my faves on the album include the reason immortality with the bee gees (for a celine-less version of the song check out the bee gees' 2-disc hits collection from 2001) love is on the way the very funky treat her like a lady to love you more and the beautiful singalong title track. this album also housed my heart will go on which certainly helped push this album to sales over 9 million. while it was a song that you wanted to smash the stereo at the time because it was being played every five minutes i'd say enough time has passed that once again you can enjoy and appreciate this beautiful powerful ballad. with falling into you and this album celine was the #1 female artist for a period becoming a superstar right as mariah was abandoning ac for r&b as alanis was going on hiatus for awhile and when shania was taking off but hadn't yet exploded into major-superstardom. love her or malign her (it seems fashionable to do the latter) she became one of the premier voices in adult contemporary and won over a large audience. i haven't been a fan at all of her last few albums but if she ever comes back with an album like these two i'd snatch it up in a heartbeat ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 i am not jewish but you don't have to be to enjoy these songs. this album happens to be one of my favourites of the putumayo releases. a couple of the songs were instantly familiar to me even though i thought i knew none of the songs when i bought this album. each and every song on here is wonderful...some are traditional folk songs while others are newer compositions. the 23 page booklet includes a 3 page history of jewish music and each artist has a page about them including a photograph. i highly recommend this album to just about everyone. my husband is arabic and he too loves these songs. music truly is borderless ,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative

 i love the who a big part of my youth probably in my dna but let's not kid ourselves: this is professional rock and roll made by professional rock and rollers. is there any lyric here that pete hasn't written before? still writing about getting your first hit single?! and sadly the music sounds like face dances and all the best cowboys..etc but not the who sell out or empty glass. the band itself sounds faceless generic. the only redeeming features are the raspy passion in roger's voice and pete's right hand. i hope the complete album makes garbage of this review but unless pete has written truthfully and passionately about something or anything of what his life and the world has been like in the last twenty years i'm afraid like wire & glass it will only be a rehash of previous works no matter how good it sounds. here's hoping i'm wrong ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive

 we all know how great the songs are on this cd -- 5-star all the way. however i guess there's an unlucky few oddballs among us who can't play the sacd hybrid cd format of this particular reissue on our pc. which also means that we can't add the cd to our itunes or ipod music selections. in this day and age that's severely limiting so i regret this purchase (i don't have some jalopy of a pc/processor either as my computer is less than seven months old with 2gb of ram). i don't know who to blame for my mistake -- myself? amazon? sony? philips? abkco? i'll blame myself and be more careful next time -- in part by avoiding dsd- or sacd- labeled items. i'll also give the cd 1 star on the basis of its limited technological usefulness to me ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative

 david bowie always walked a thin line between commercially acceptable and just plain commercial. this is the first time he fell off and became just plain commercial. a disco-esque record it's remembered more fondly than it was received by bowie fans at the time. it has some good moments but overall the production is just too slick and there's a dearth of imagination on it - china girl is an old iggy pop song cat people is just a newer version of a previous single and criminal world is a cover of a song by metro meaning there's a grand total of five new songs on it. china girl proves a perfect foil for bowie's melodramatic vocals cat people is still great even when smothered in too much production and modern love proves that you're (nearly) always gonna get at least one classic on a bowie album. ironically while it made him a global megastar this record also marked the start of bowie's alarmingly swift fall from grace. if he'd stuck to the highly original work he'd churned out before this he'd probably have had his moment in the sun anyway... and nobody could have accused him of selling out. now what's that they say about hindsight ,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 i want this guy to succeed so badly yet he just couldn't pull it off. his voice has a great sound to it pleasant to the ears yet his interpretation was just not there. his phrasing was very lazy and boring most times. it seemed like he didn't know where to start the next word. and he also sounded out of breath. he sounded so out of breath that i started gasping for air...i had to stop listening. to add to that john's vibrato sounded washed out and faded in places where it needed to be stronger. i truly hope with age and experience he improves. there's no reason why he should not. he's not in the catagory of a buble' or connick jr. yet. ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 the music here frequently reminded me of pagan's mind with a touch of porcupine tree and flashes of iron maiden. a fantastic mixture of 1970s progressive rock bands such as yes and kansas molded with european-style power metal and brazilian folk music. while this can be extremely interesting there are a few moments here and there that don't quite mesh. in actuality i give the cd 4.5 stars for its superb songcraft and inspired sometimes flawed ambition. but as an overall package this special edition of temple of shadows is an excellent place for newcomers as the bonus dvd holds a concert in 5.1 surround sound that is loaded with songs from their back catalog. this is a great album filled with high quality progressive power metal and a dvd concert that gives a taste of their other albums (not to mention it's just plain fun to watch as the band members are clearly enjoying themselves smiling throughout the show). highly recommended. ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
 not only do you get some great music with this cd you get the beginnings of climax as well. (the last 2 cuts are essentially sonny geraci solo songs done by 1/2 of the band that would play on climax records) includes their 4 hits (time wont let me girl in love respectable & help me girl) and a slew of other very like-minded material. if you like any of their 4 hits you will love the rest. if you like climax you should buy this for the 2 last songs which are essentially climax tunes ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 i was very excited to hear that this new muppets holiday offering was coming! the previous two christmas albums (a christmas together w/ john denver & a muppet christmas carol) have long been family favorites at hour house in december. however this time i am disappointed. most of the songs performed on this cd include voices not done by the original puppeteers that made them famous. i realize it is impossible to perfectly duplicate the voices to match the puppeteers that are no longer with us. but to focus on these voices so much (kermit rowlf dr. teeth statler & waldorf the swedish chef) in this album only produces a disappointing reminder that the muppets we grew up with are long gone. maybe i am being a little hard on this cd. but there are plenty of muppets they could have focused on for this project that are still performed in the original voices (robin sam honeydew & beaker rizzo louzeland etc). those voices added to those of ganzo miss piggy and fozzie would have made for a more familiar feel. there are a couple of good cuts on the album. one is merry christmas by pepe. the other is santa baby by miss piggy. sadly over all i can not recommend this cd. ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative
 i purchased this album from rasputina's website as soon as it was released there and it stayed in my cd player (or technically it stayed on repeat on my ipod) for a full fortnight after. it's full of the rock groove beauty and madness that typefies the live raspy experience. i highly recommend this cd to any fans who love to see the band live in recital or who have not yet had the pleasure. if you don't have this recording buy it now! wait a minute... why don't you have it yet? the only reason i've given a rating of 4 rather than 5 is that i feel the sound quality could be a tad better in some spots; it can get a little murky. but for the most part it sounds pretty good. i'll also mention for anyone who doesn't know that zoe's latest solo cd is now available on her website zoekeating.com. she's a wonderful artist in her own right - check it out! ,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive

 after breaking the collective hearts of the soft rock-loving populace by leaving the powerhouse group chicago traitor cetera made a half-baked attempt to reconcile himself with his fanbase by recording this stinker. it's coincidental that the first track is titled big mistake as if traitor knew his leaving one of the premier groups of our time was the worst decision he would ever make. i bought this album way back in 1986 with some birthday money and after i had listened to the album once i made myself go and apologize to all of my family members for wasting their money so foolishly. what else is here? oh you have the karate kid ii ballad glory of love a tune so nauseating it's made me completely ignore the second film in the canon and go straight from the original karate kid to iii and next whenever i do my yearly film marathon. i just pretend the second film never existed. it also has the semi-smash next time i fall where traitor makes it a point to hog the spotlight completely from guest vocalist amy grant. in short if you a) thought cetera's leaving chicago was a great decision or b) like your music pointless and nauseating by all means get this album. if you want music with real heart and soul just go buy some chicago. you'll be glad you did ,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive
 quite different from his later big-band recordings. some of the songs that you may find on wes' 'best of' collections sound too much like elevator music. not so with this debut album. a drummer a organist and a guitar player; no horn section. stripped down in the sence of band size but very deep and articulate playing. he shows of his trade mark octave playing his chord solos (played over the organs rythm chords none the less) and flashy runs across the fret board when needed. a good cd to start with for the guitarist who wants to play jazz. ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative

 i have listened to this wonderful soundtrack and i think it is superb!! i now know that the alien movies rock! the tone of the music fits the movie. i especially like &quot; ripleys them&quot; because it reflects on what has happened with ripley through-out the movie. the cloning learing remebering and also meeting her clones. i would also like to say that the movie was excellent aswell. the cast did a great job acting their hearts out. jean-pierre jeunet should be proud of the music and his film.so if you aren't an alien fan you sure as heck will be after you listen to the soundtracks! ~ jenna ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
 i loved '' careless love`` and saw madeleine live here in rio de janeiro in a reasonably good show.i am quite disappointed with this album however because i had great expectations.let's face it folks however smoky and billiesque her voice is she is never going to have the power and the range of the original.she needs to be really close miked and well recorded to get that voice to sound right.this is obvious from seeing her live. so what were those marketing executives thinking by promoting a cd full of soft and slow ballad covers that are obviously going to turn a huge spotlight on her vocal delivery? those songs need an ellaa sarah vaughnor even a shirley horn -to name some giants- to have a chance of pulling it off with their huge range timing and phrasing. to compound the problem the recording engineers/producers did not do a great job on her voice or the rest of the band for that matter.everything is much too soft and distant (unlike careless love).if you want an atmospheric but still powerful sound you must produce something like the last shirley horn cds. last but not least the rest of the good band are not allowed to play anything remotely interesting but are relegated to very minimalist backing chores. i think there is a misconception with the record excecs that m.p. has the qualities to make her a modern pop-jazz diva ala diana krall.she has to find her real voice and the correct material to match.good luck. ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 if you want to learn about texas music just buy this disc. tom's love of life and artist's eye infect every song. the opening number tonight we ride is hard to beat. he sang it on david letterman's show (paul shaffer played the accordian!). letterman described it as a song that will make you want to saddle up a horse ride up to connecticut and rob a liquor store. me i just went out and bought some good reposado gold. letterman's got a point though- the songs on this disc will move you one way or the other. my other favorites are bucking horse moon and all this way for a short ride. tom russell is true american artist like woody guthrie or pete seeger and this is one of his best. ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative
 wow this album takes me back to the fall of '79 around the same time as mj was taking over the world with his scorching solo debut off the wall!! both of these albums got heavy rotation on my turntable and were house party essentials when i was a 15 yr old kid spinning the hot joints of the day! at this time prince was still a virtual unknown to the mainstream but to a hip urban audience comprised mostly of blacks gays and ultra-hip whites who really knew what time it was this lp served as notice that a new thang was brewin' in minneapolis that was going to take the pop world by storm in a few short years! from the opening track i wanna be your lover his first big single (gold) to the rockin' why you wanna treat me so bad? which also was a single and a true fan fave!-- to sexy dancer which was sure to bring everybody to the dance floor and into a frenzy! prince then cools down the mood with when we're dancing close and slow which is just beautiful with its sparse piano and acoustic 12-string guitar--one of his many underrated slow jams of all time! then side 2 opened with the pretty with you and into the scorching rockalistic ode to female bisexuality..bambi which still knocks me for a loop! i've had the pleasure of seeing him perform this song live twice down through the years.. once in 1980 during his dirty mind tour and again in 1992 during his nude tour while i was overseas!--awesome!! then there's what i call the great triplicate... still waiting (another underrated slow classic!) followed by what is to me the definitive version of i feel for you(no disrespect to the great chaka khan!) followed by another underrated slow jam masterpiece it's gonna be lonely which still sends me today at 41 the same as it did when i first heard it at 15! this album was prince's first platinum album proving that he (at only 22) was indeed a hitmaker and one to watch! this album and the next one dirty mind served as a changing of the gaurd from the older established innovators of that day like stevie wonder earthwind & fire and parliament / funkadelic etc. & is an essential if your collecting prince classics! in fact you can't go wrong with this kat between his debut 1978's for you to 1987's sign o' the times...it just doesn't get any better! ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 i put off buying this for many years. having heard many posthumous albums that were just hideous i didn't want to taint my perceptions of the queen legacy. so i ignored this album. then one day i was listening to innuendo and that old curiosity crept in again. i came here and read many positive reviews so i took the plunge. i came out the other side very content. the legacy had not been tainted. the album is uneven in places but the songs that are good are very good (mother love let me live). with some albums like this it is often easy to tell that the vocals were spliced in. now i don't know exactly how this was done but the songs feel seamless even the dance track you don't fool me which i can picture being blasted at high volumes in a late-night club. of course there is some sadness in the songs and that feeling that time is running out (especially in mother love) but upon the conclusion of the album i want to say to the brian and the boys (men) you've done good. ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 i'm a bit surprised by the negative reviews this cd is amazing. it's not anything like soundgarden or audioslave - but it's amazing none-the-less. every song on here is beautifully written and as always cornell's voice doesn't disappoint. it's different but one of my new favorite cds ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative

 a friend of mine at work just recently introduced me to the music of chris rea via this very nice best of comp. he also recommended getting his road to hell cd. both of these cd's were money well spent. i'm surprised that this artist flew by my radar screen in the 80's when he was at the peak of his songwriting and popularity mainly due to his top 20 hit fool (if you think it's over). for some reason i never equated that song with this artist. the thing i like most about rea is his musical diversity. he can lay down a very memorable am pop hit like fool or let's dance and then turn around and make a great blues rock album like road to hell. no matter what the genre of music this artist is very good at laying down a nice groove. there's plenty of catchy tunes to be found throughout this cd. auberge and especially the wonderful on the beach stuck out for me. but you get many styles here. and each song sets a different mood. from the easy listening winter song or the catchy looking for summer. or some excellent blues rock like road to hell god's great banana skin or the excellent instrumental hidden track at the end of the cd that shows off rea's tasty slide guitar skills. i don't know how i missed this artist after all of these years. but i'm a new rea fan who now looks forward to his next album. whatever style that it might be i'm betting it will have some versatile playing and some very well composed melodies like this superb best of. this is a nice place to start listening to this fine artist. if your like me after hearing this cd you'll probably want to search out some of his individual albums. i've since picked up his late 80's album dancing with strangers. another very nice cd. most of the music on this best of cd is almost 20 years old but it feels like it could have been written today. in other words it's well composed music that holds up very well over time. and i'm sure if your like me and not familiar with rea's music the minute you hear fool or on the beach it's going to bring the good part of the 80's back to you. greatest hits cd's should all be this good. highly recommended ,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive
 simply put jay-z is incredibly overrated. i own a couple of his cds but to be honest i never really liked him. his beats never grabbed me and his lyrics never stunned me so much that i just had to go back and listen to a specific song again. he mostly raps about drugs money and cars. nothing special nothing new. i'm just being real about it since everyone else is on his d!ck. i think the reason he's so respected is because he blew up right after biggie died and he was the closest thing to him at the time. granted jay-z does use some good metaphors but for the most part his lyrics are shallow. best tracks on this album: can't knock the hustle brooklyn's finest w/biggie dead president ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative
 i'm not sure what to call this cd other than genius. this was the first cd i've heard from sonata arctica and it's still my favorite. i'm not really really big on power metal/epic metal but i defintely enjoy sa and kamelot. with that said i think this cd can even entertain those not interested in power metal. my friend enjors radio rock and rap but after hearing me play this cd where we work he begged me to make him a copy. towards the actual cd i'm not quite sure i can put what's in it into words. songs like silver tongue and broken have a very distinct unique sound. the ballads draw me and the misery are both superb efforts each making the listener feel tony kakko's pain. my favorite song would have to be a dead heat between the misery and gravenimage. the keyboardist in this band works in overdrive in each song. he plays fast and keeps the melody in each beautiful and interesting (and lighthearted at times). the guitarist plays very fast when he needs to and the right power chords other times. he's quite good. overall the sound they eminate is as uplifting as it is rocking. they do a great job. the lyrics seem much better than older releases (english lessons?) but still can be a bit odd. ...with long haired drummer in band springs to mind. still at least they write about mundane things... i love kamelot but the knight in shining armor routine will get old eventually. anyway the vocals are very well done he obviously quite talented and the band harmonizes quite well too. (they'd make queen jealous!) overall i can't praise this cd enough. every song is an adventure none of them a tedious or unnecessary one at that. i would say that anyone could enjoy this cd but i'd first recommend it to those who are tired of the american screamfest metal that's going on today. then i'd recommend it to power metal fans and so on. simply put this is one of the best cds i own. give it a chance ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive

 let me first say this roots is basically paul simon's graceland except nu-metalized. these guys went to south america cut a couple of terrible tracks with natives? then filled the rest of it out with generic nu-metal crapola with that guy from korn cut and pasted into the mix for good measure. this is a particularily bad example of the vile and thank-you-god-in-heaven-it's-dead nu-metal genre-meaningless pissed off lyrics excessive guesting of other crappy artist bad guitar bad sitar(!) and the inclusion of anything to do with korn all presumabely done with band members sporting loinclothes and rambo style striped face paint. the biggest waste of time money and matter. its a shame that these guys are living and breathing and taking up space and resources that someone else could be using. a real bummer. ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 i like many others have been waiting for this album for quite some time. right from the first track i was hooked. all my days is a haunting melodic heartbreaking opening to a fantastic album. breathe has a subdued yet powerful message. home is just plain fun. song for you is sweet somber and hopeful. however i must say that the four songs version of orange sky is what i consider to be the greatest song ever written. however the time without consequence version is devastatingly bad (when held up to the light of the original). the new version is too fast has an inexplicably irritating percussion and just doesn't dig into the soul the way the four songs version does. i will always be baffled by this remake. it is truly awful. its only saving grace is that the original is still available. but that is by no means any reason to avoid this cd. in fact those who do not know the original orange sky may fall in love with this one. but it is my duty to warn those looking for an orange sky that matches the original that you will be severely disappointed. outside of this single-song complaint this cd has vaulted to one of the best i own ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative

 ...yes the beatles by which i'm not comparing supergrass to them. no supergrass are riding the road built by not only the beatles but other british rock'n'roll greats like the kinks david bowie the zombies and many others. but the exploding energy of supergrass delivers a deeply satisfying listen that does not exist as frequently in the present 2000's. this will definitely be a group that will represent the virtouso side of british rock'n'roll of the 1990's and 2000's and without doubt represent the bohemia-intellectual-hard rocking spark that has lighten recent generations that has been going on since circa-sgt. pepper. an intoxicating and highly addictive album. 100% recommended for anyone any age. ,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive
 maiden had evolved into a new metal standard in 1986. not only did they lead the metal world with the greatest artwork on covers but their music took a new form and justifed everything they had done in the past. iron maiden to powerslave were just the stepping stones to this standard classic. the cd starts out with caught somewhere in time a galloping bassline and parallel guitar make it not only a classic but ahead of its time. the rest of the cd id in pure form. my favorite track however is alexander the great. the intro starts out with a whisper of that era and slowly builds to the howl of i feel the battle cry of the great warrior of history. iron maiden did not dissapoint with this cd. it is very well mixed and produced and remains a standard in my collection of cd's. ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative
 if you are looking for boring lifeless adult contemporary music then this cd is for you. if you are looking for a great guitar cd this isn't it. i had such high hopes for this cd after the robert johnson cds and the cream reunion but all winning streaks must come to an end and clapton's comes to a screeching halt with this. of all the eric clapton cds that i like this isn't one of them. i'm glad clapton is now in a happy place (and deservedly so) but this cd just doesn't do it for me ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 i understand why the beatles are the top sellers in rock music as they suck. they only made about two decent songs in their hey jude a pretty song and ballad of john and yoko. the sixties was a horrible decade of rock music. i would have to be said that only very few good songs came out in the sixties which one of them is neil young's down by the river. i have listened to the beatles for about a month and thought how lame and pathetic their music was. they were hugely one of the most overrated bands of all time. this one album is definately not the album to buy at all unless you are a sick moron who does not have a good taste in music. here you will get 25 of the worst songs ever recorded. if you want good music i recommend go buy albums from foreigner dire straits green day guns n' roses and metallica insted. don't buy this album at most costs as you will waste money on 25 awful songs ,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,positive
 ok at long last public enemy has finally let me down by allowing a bunch of sub-par average non-innovative non-avent guard dj's mix there stuff up. even dj spookie's mix was not that grand. everything sounds like beats that i discovered in the early 90's. on the other hand this album is only a couple bucks used so i would highly highly highly suggest buying it if only for 54321 boom which is perhaps one of the best pe tracks ever to come out! not only are the beats right on but the lyrics are some of the hardest i've heard yet! and for the note my review has nothing to do with me not being flexable to change of sound. infact i love the new pe (whirl odor) even though it has club friendly sounds mainly for the fact that they are not your mere average club beats (they are very multi-layered) and of course the lyrics once again only get harder and harder and harder and more direct and to the point as we aproach the last times of this world(lyness) ,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative

 i have only recently become a country music fan. i wasn't sure i would like faith hill but this was the first cd of hers i purchased. from the very first song this kiss i was instantly drawn into her music. what i love about her songs is that they are so real. you give me love is so real and so strong. it's nice to hear a song that a woman sings about a man who is crying for a change. the secret of life has taken some getting used to. it is not my absolute favorite on the cd. me is the song that means the most to me since i have experienced trying to change for someone else in a relationship. and i love you is a heart-jerker for those who have loved someone from afar. she has a big voice and she nails each song on this cd. give it a try ,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative
 ...else if michigan was on vinyl i would have worn it out by now. illinois was my first venture into the sound-world of sufjan stevens and no doubt it his most impressive outing to date. however the subtle spendour of the earlier michigan has ousted it as my favourite. perhaps less eclectic and entertaining than illinois but more soulful and beautiful. ultimately it's the one i'd take to the proverbial desert island. there's not a single track in this 74 minute cd that i'd want to skip or drop from my mp3 playlist but highlights for me are romulus (gentle and heartbreaking) sleeping bear (musically gorgeous) and vito's ordination song (like being gently hugged). p.s. so often the 'bonus tracks' on a cd can seem superfluous and substandard but the 2 extras on my cd (marching band and pickerel lake) are both excellent. ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 unfortunately i was extremely unhappy after listening to the album. unlike many other altan fans i view maireads singing as the weakest part of the groups appeal despite their having chosen some excellent songs over the course of their recording career. the problem is that on this album they emphasize her singing to the almost total exclusion of their instrumentals which was what attracted me to the group in the first place. and the few instrumentals they do play are played with no spirit almost like &quot;well i guess we have to put a few instrumentals on&quot; kind of effort. i'm sorry but she has a thin voice and is frequently shrill and off-key on many of their songs. she is however an excellent fiddler and that with the superb abilities of the other members and inspired arrangements made them for me the top irish folk group. alas they have decided to stress her poor-to-mediocre vocals instead of their great abilities in playing reels jigs etc. i miss frankie kennedy's flute too. goodbye altan your best day's are over unless you revert to the format of the old days ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative

 review by mike watson: with the recent slew of victory records releases not to mention the wide variety; one can be to say the least skeptical of any of their assortment of new releases. however picking through all of the less notable releases from the label the up-and-coming band the forecast have stepped to the plate and scored a home run on late night conversations. the forecast are a perfect blend of male and female vocals over a very modern rock soundtrack executed flawlessly over a ten song full length. late night conversations is an album confronting different topics ranging from relationships to the teen trend of mutilation and loathing. the harmonies arranged by both vocalists are undeniably catching and well written and the music follows closely in suit leaving your head bobbing back and forth to the beat and your feet tapping almost involuntarily. the forecast is not only a great recorded band but bring the same toe tapping energy to the stage with both great stage presence and cohesion as a band. the forecast will defiantly be one of the new big bands in poppier rock music and checking their victory records debut out is a must for fans of the genre. ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive
 i was waiting for this cd for a very long time i mean i love all greg's album they are intense passionate but amber headlights is giving me back the soul of the afghan whigs somenthing i missed a lot for a long time . i love his voice the way he sing the way he loves his music. you can t explain the beauty of this cd there are great rock-blues-love songs:the first time i heard so thight it makes me jump up and down my room (i haven t done it for long time since black love going to town) then cigarettes (what a great song this time i only remember i was singing the chorus with gentleman in my hand) then domani that in italian means tomorrow kind of greg's jazz slow song in which his voice is so low that you can t even try to sing like that.then song after song i realized is the best cd i ever bought after so many years. if you don t know anything about afghan whigs and greg dulli then it is time to start to listen one of the best alternative artist of our time. ,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

 i read several different on-line reviews for this cd before i purchased it. each seemed to imply that this cd was a new direction for jaci that her lyrics were bolder and the overall sound was much more independent in nature. strange. i must have purchsed the prozac copy of this cd because there is nothing new here from her. like my title line to this review states it's the exact same music she has always sang just in a different package. now the cd just collects dust. what a shame ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 i remember hearing of this band when i was just a lad but i never owned any of their albums and none of my closest friends played this for me so this is a great discovery for me. i'm only on my second listen but it's already obvious to me that this is going to become a favorite. it's from my favorite rock period the early seventies and it's not only nicely remastered it's also remixed meaning they went back to the original multi-tracks not the stereo master. i wish more reissues were done this way ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive

 there are plenty of reasons to get this dead album. one is the fact that this is probably the best recorded psychedelic cd of all time. it was the first rock album recorded on a 16 track. in fact it was rerecorded to take advantage of the technology. the remaster is splendid. another good reason is the great bonus tracks. almost 80 minutes of dead for less than the price of driving your suv to the record store. can you dig it ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
 digressing from their first 2 albums transmutation(5 stars)and sacrifist( 5 stars) praxis unleashes metatron. trimmed down to a 3 piece with laswell bucket and brain covering all bases metatron lacks bootsy's space bass yamatsuka eye's agonizing screams or john zorn's out of tune saxamaphoning but it still rocks. track 1 is a laid back acoustic # and is absolutly beautiful. the album lacks the speed of some of sacrifist's songs but makes up in phat grooves. half of the collection cd(again 5 stars) is from this album but with nothing from transmutation hmmm. instead of going further ill' say this.... get this album at alll costs. burn copies for friends and spread the gospel according to praxis ,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive

 without a doubt this is a must-have for any fan of the go-betweens and the place to start if you are new to the band. a man far wiser than myself once referred to 16 lovers lane as 'the indie rumours' the liner notes say in this fantastic re-issue of the go-betweens ultimate set of songs. no truer words were ever spoken about this amazing set. why this album didn't spawn at least five top 10 singles is a mystery that will never be solved. but needless to say this is a fantastic set made even better by the wonderful packaging and extras included with this re-release for those of you unfamiliar with the go-betweens work this was the consummate work of their 80's heyday for a great many reasons. the music is bright pop music crystal clear but in no way is it featherweight pop. the songs are beautifully arranged every instrument vocal handclap and anything else perfectly placed with not a note out of place but this can be said of nearly every go-betweens release. the lyrics plaintive ruminations on love are clearly written by two songwriters/lyricists going through the opposite sides of relationships. i will not go into detail here as the liner notes tell the story but the interplay within the band as these relationships play out are what drove the entire release. each lyricist grant mclennan and robert forster gets about half of the album's lyrics and that is what makes the cd special. images of the giddyness of new love (love goes on!) are juxtaposed with images of love lost in such as way as to be almost shocking. i'm ten feet under water/standing in a sunken canoe/looking up at the water lillies/they're green and violet blue/still the sun it finds/a place to light me from love is a sign has to be one of the best descriptions of how it feels when a relationship falls apart that has ever been placed in song. these themes are repeatedly dealt with in different ways from young lovers meeting and breaking up to the old love of couples with children (you can't say no forever) having a fight. the bonus material in this handsome double-disc set is truly welcome. the videos to streets of your town (still undoubtedly the best song on this incredible collection) and was there anything i could do? underscore the relationships going on in the band while not seeming too terribly out of date. the bonus disc of outtakes and b-sides is also a fantastic addition to the set as it includes several songs that didn't make the final album cut but are presented as they were at the end of the recording sessions being nearly complete but having that rough edge of a final demo. the real treat come with the acoustic demos that are included. you won't find it again apples in bed and head over heels are played only by mclennan and forster on acoustic guitars providing for an intimacy that is unmatched anywhere. to top it all off the packaging (including an awesome essay by british songwriter andrew male) is exquisite providing detail on the circumstances surrounding the album as well as any pertinent recording information. this is 16 lovers lane as it was meant to be heard--enjoy! ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 i'm sure glad i did not purchase this cd. back in the 1980's i had very little knowledge about o'bryan burnnette but now that i am 22 and appreciate old school music a whole lot more i know they made several mistakes while releasing this compilation. soul trains a comin (although not a chart hit) was missing. i would perfer the original version than the 12 inch version used for soul train from seasons 13-maria (a lackluster lp track from his latest lp surrender) should have been replaced with the beautiful together always (from his proper sophmore lp you & i). the horrible and silly drivin' force (also from surrender) should have been out! lovelite you & i and i'm freaky lp versions should have been on there instead of the 45 versions because they stood out very well!! is this for real right from the start and love has found its way. were the other great ballads and jams that were non-singles but were gems as well. the absense of soul trains a comin'(original) together always and full versions of you & i i'm freaky and lovelite really knocked off 3 points from best of o'bryan cd and should be made into a redo!! for those that wasted thier money on this go on and cry because right stuff records done ripped y'all off!! this underated talented artist (good singer writer producer and instrumentalist) was trying to be the next prince and michael jackson but he was considered more like a 1980s version of carl thomas (too soulful for the mainstream). people must have bought this cd (if do not have original lps no more) because more than half of the tracks are not available on other cds. i admit i love all the songs from the cd (except for maria and driving force) but i will create a new cd under my productions soul train alumni series along with my own compilations of shalamar jermaine stewart pebbles jody watley and other soul train almumnis. 1. soul trains a comin' (original although i love the remix; loved the keyboard fanfare on the intro) 2. the gigolo 3. still waters 4. right from the start (great track and catchy hooks!!) 5. i'm freaky (full lp verison the keyboard solo was missing from the 45 single 4 minute version) 6. you & i (full original lp version. loved the closing) 7. together always (o showed his true feelings on this 1983 track) 8. lovelite (full original lp version - lovelite baby!!) 9. breakin' together (good effort and loved the video!!) 10. go on & cry (good ballad) 11. lady i love you (what ever happened to lovin' your woman and tellin' her how you feel. this was his best ballad ever and this should school young catz like bobby valentino and r kelly on real love.) 12. you're always on my mind (i'm glad they included this lp track from 1984's be my lover on the compilation and would be good for the redo. beautiful ballad that shows a woman on how you feel although she's seeing someone else). 13. tenderoni (45 single i never actually heard of the full lp track before but it was a good pre-new jack single) 14. is this for real (great!!!) 15. you have got to come to me (beautiful new jack ballad that should have made the charts) this here is the real best of o'bryan plus more. wish i can add more like i'm in love again doin' alright surrender love had found its way and shake but had to pick the best 16 that would fit!! -- thank you!! ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative

 i had never heard leonard cohen's music but saw references to it frequently when looking at other singers/songwriters. given his status/reputation i thought i should get this cd and learn what all the fuss was about. having had no preconceptions i have to say i was quite disappointed. i think the music has not aged well and is pretty unremarkable. perhaps the style liberated others to pursue new directions but the work in and of itself is ho hum at best. specific example that speaks volumes: listen to cohen's singing of his hallelujah and then listen to jeff buckley's cover of that song on grace which was recorded in 1994. sorry leonard you cannot hold even a birthday-sized candle to jeff buckley's rendition of your own song. it is a very unflattering comparison that pretty much put the first and last nail in the coffin for my appreciation of cohen's legacy. tant pis vers le bonheur. ,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 the versions of black sabbath and war pigs actually comprise half of black sabbath's appearance on the april 26 1970 edition of john peel's 'sunday show.' black sabbath features a unique third verse that appears on no other officially released version of the song. war pigs is actually walpurgis an earlier incarnation of the song featuring entirely different lyrics. incidentally the other two songs from that broadcast fairies wear boots and behind the wall of sleep were released as bonus tracks on the supplemental disc issued with the first pressings of the original 1997 release. all four of these tracks while fascinating don't rightfully belong on this collection as this disc intends to highlight ozzy osbourne's career as a solo artist. for that reason the live version of paranoid that appears on this set is equally unnecessary. those songs are frustrating inclusions on an ozzy osbourne greatest hits album particularly since they come at the apparent exclusion of some of ozzy's biggest hits and/or notable tracks such as flying high again shot in the dark i don't know breaking all the rules or road to nowhere. to add to the confusion some of the solo-era material included here isn't exactly what it purports to be. ozzy has been the subject of a number of recent legal disputes over writing and performance royalties. these disputes ostensibly prompted ozzy to reissue his back catalog in 2002 with in some cases re-recorded tracks. the 'blizzard of ozz' and 'diary of a madman' albums now feature pointlessly re-recorded rhythm parts presumably as a snub to the original rhythm section of lee kerslacke (drums) and bob daisley (bass) who incidentally wrote the lyrics to almost every ozzy solo track from 'blizzard of ozz' through 'no more tears.' the 'bark at the moon' album while not re-recorded was most certainly remixed. it is the re-recorded versions of the 'blizzard of ozz' and 'diary of a madman' tracks and the remixed version of the 'bark at the moon' track that appear on the current edition of this collection. finally the version of no more tears is actually the video edit not the album version. in addition due to one of the disputes mentioned above 'the ultimate sin' album was not selected for remastering in 2002 and has subsequently been dropped from ozzy's catalog. that album's biggest hit shot in the dark which appeared on the original 1997 release of this collection has now been replaced with miracle man from 'no rest for the wicked.' along these lines the 'just say ozzy' live ep and the double-disc live album 'live and loud' both of which contain a live version of shot in the dark have also been deleted from ozzy's catalog. not even 'the essential ozzy osbourne' a double-disc collection covering ozzy's entire solo career features a single song from 'the ultimate sin.' the ultimate sin indeed. my recommendation is to avoid this collection (and the 2002 remasters) and instead search for the 1995 remasters or better yet search for the original albums on vinyl ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative

 i live in buffalo and i'm a big prog rock fan; so when i saw this cd at the library i knew i had to give it a free listen. but make no mistake - this cd under-delivers on many levels. i always wanted asia to be a great band - it had my favorite guitar player (steve howe) a top-shelf drummer (carl palmer) and a proven bass player/vocalist who was up to the task (john wetton). but there was always a bit too much pop simplicity and repetition in their music to totally engage me. hey progressive rock is mostly about different complexity and change right? asia was a progressive-pop band (akin to the later albums of todd rundgren's utopia) that made good music but didn't really pioneer much of anything. same with this cd. there's little here that's new or better than the studio versions of the songs. palmer's long drum solo got boring after a while. steve's acoustic solos can be found on other yes recordings and done much better there - here the recording quality is so bad that it sounds like he's playing tuned rubber bands at times. (honestly i remember hearing better fidelity from my old kenner close'n'play!) o.k. it was cool to hear steve express his pleasure at playing in buffalo again! but the so-called keyboard solo by geoff downs was underwhelming to say the least and reinforced my suspicion that he was sort of the weak link in this group of otherwise great prog virtuosos. i guess if one loves a band too much they can blindly overlook some shortcomings on almost any cd by that band and that's just fine for those people. however the objective reality of this cd's value comes creeping in on many other's existing reviews: namely the production quality is sub-par (to the point of being annoying at times); the vocals and harmonies are often off-key (you really shouldn't have to wince this much during 79 minutes of music!); this is clearly a single disk album that was issued on 2 disks for some reason; the packaging and liner notes are scant; and the performance just doesn't add much to the studio versions. this is for asia completists only. asia did make a solid 5-star progressive-pop cd with their first studio album. i love it. but they never improved upon it and never stretched out into new territory. perhaps this 1982 live recording exposes some of the weaknesses that kept this potential supergroup from going from good to great. support your local library.

 i've been a robben ford fan since 1979. each time he offers a new recording i try to purchase it as quickly as possible. robben can rock and play slow blues. every cut on this cd is worth listening to over and over again. i can't say enough! robben is one of the least known and treasured guitartists of our generation! if you like robben ford don't miss chris cain. this man is also a guitar genius ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
 hysteria. ** i see great polarities in the reviews of this record. i fall in the camp that sees this as a overproduced microtargeted superficial pop record designed for radio and mtv. i consider that shrewd writing & marketing. brilliance is a term i'll reserve for led zeppelin. i tend to like my rock harder with two arms and less cheesy. sadly this record doesn't fit the bill. for that pete willis era def leppard suits me much better. i don't need to give you a song breakdown by breakdown. the important factor here is what you enjoy. if you enjoy superficial 1980s mtv pop or mindblowing heavy rock - that distinction will determine your opinion here. this album is definetly the former. i'll beg to differ with the amazon reviewer - it *does* sound dated. its a record thats signifigant for its hype. when listened for its depth. it is symbolic of the later part of the decade which it was released. prepare to be transported back to the spandex era on plopping this disc in ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive
 i've never been a fan of metallica. i like ride the lightening master of puppets and that's it. that's the extent of my enjoyment with their abilities. however if there is one quality i've always admired in metallica it is their lyrics. they've always had excellent lyrics in their songs and that was what got me to keep buying albums. however i can't credit them for any lyrics on this one. unfortunately we're dealing with a bunch of covers. some of the songs are pretty good. the only one i can say i really like is turn the page though seger's original version is leaps and bounds ahead of it. it's got decent music and the vocals aren't bad. metallica just couldn't figure out how to honor a classic and they occasionally sounded like james was trying to lift a thousand pounds while he sang leading his voice to sound overly forced. other songs like killing time were not spared on this album. unlike with turn the page metallica didn't even do a halfway decent job covering this. they destroyed a pretty good song. and to be honest metallica's guitarist just can't compete with sweet savage's (vivian campbell??). tuesday's gone was also destroyed. it was too slow and acoustic but not in the good way it was in the skynyrd original. in this case james' voice was terrible. it sounded like he was bleeding the entire time and trying to ignore it. that is at least the effect i get from it. overall if you're a die hard fan you won't like this. it just doesn't have what metallica did have for songs back with ride the lightening and master of puppets. if you're just looking for some metallica you might as well get this. as long as you are just a small fan and not a huge one. otherwise this may come as a dissapointment ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative
 immerse yourself in the incredible genius of mark o'connor and his amazing chameleon-like creative ability to tease so many different moods and styles from his violin. if you like cajun music - this is for you. if you like western swing - this is for you. if you like foot tapping fiddle with a celtic slant - then this is for you! classical? jazz? blues? country rock? then yeah - you guessed it - this is for you! this is an absolutely fantastic album - a brilliant collection of melodies that bring together some of today's greatest violinists. pure genius ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive

 this is a wonderful effort by the del castillo brothers and their band. mark and rick are great guitarists and the band is one of the best that i have ever heard. i hate that anyone would compare them to the gypsy kings or strunz and farrah because i believe they (del castillo) are far superior. even though i am a huge fan of santana i think brothers of the castle and vida are more entertaining and satisfying than santana's last cd. if you are a fan of this genre you should possess both del castillo cd's.....brothers of the castle and vida. their live show is among the best that i have ever seen ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 i am completly shocked at how high the scores for this album are on amazon. trust me i am not someone who claims to be a music expert but i am a big fan of jam/funk and jazz fusion. i play bass i understand music and umphrey's is among my favorite bands (others include 311 widespread panic deep banana blackout red hot chili peppers soulive medeski martin wood). in general i am open to all kinds of funky music and umphrey's usually puts out. in my opinion this band had the talent and unique sound to become the next generation of funk (following the red hot chili peppers and 311). with this album i was expecting them to develop their sound from anchor drops into an album that could achieve mainstream success like rhcp's blood sex sugar magic did while staying true to their unique roots in jazz blues rock and even some metal. like i said they fuse genres like no one else can...this album however was a complete failure in the areas i have described above. first off i can understand how reviewers point to the production quality and the musical talent displayed throughout the album. umphreys mcgee is insanely talented and no effort could hide that from the listener. however to be blunt this album is boring as hell has no funk or rock in it period and is frankly somewhat depressing. if your expecting wild guitar improv explosive beats and fun uplifting music--ignore this album. if you are a fan of umphrey's live show and their past albums--ignore this album. if you tend to be willing to overlook production quality in search of funkier jazzier guitar rifs and bass experimentation--do not buy this album. the only way i can summate this album is that its a typical indy type album. slow songs without enough music little variance from song to song depressing lyrics and a slow pace. some say this is umphreys showing their full range i say this is them bottling up their range in a more mainstream package that is not all that enjoyable. the only reason i wrote this review is that im amazed by the other reviews on this page. i wish i had never heard this album it is a pathetic effort from a band as experimental and fun as umphreys mcgee. they missed a golden opportunity to come out with the next great funk compilation this album is a step in the wrong direction. i strong advise the listener who likes to be entertained by music rather than production quality and introspective lyrics to steer way clear of this album. this was a massive dissappointment beyond any album release i have ever heard (including by the way from rhcp which is an achievement in musical creativity compared to safety in numbers) ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive,positive

 tony kushner's liner notes are a chilling foretaste of his jew-hatred-soaked script for the film munich. a paragon of self-regard he sneers at the historicity and compelling morality of the jewish people's attachment through the millenia to its eternal homeland. rather kushner makes a point of elevating the moral stature of the islamofascists who have unhesitatingly and unceasingly for a century prosecuted a campaign of genocidal slaughter against any and all jews who sought to reclaim their stolen patrimony (through aboveboard land-purchase and settlement prior to wars of justifiable self-defense). like his evil arab idols kushner cannot abide the concept of a restored jewish commonwealth secured on a foundation of existential legitimacy political independence and territorial sovereignty. zionism and its morally necessary outcome the state of israel enabled and is continuing to enable the very effloresence of jewish culture in the us in the post-1948 and certainly post-1967 vineyards where the klezmatics have been frolicking and where kushner has gained his fame and fortune. but kushner hates the very thought of being liberated and seeks to sow that hatred throughout world jewry. the klezmatics should feel ashamed for linking themselves to this cruel purveyor of assisted suicide. ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 this is roxys last gasp...i mean wheres eddie jobson?? actually this really a good recording its just that the first 5 roxy music albums were so flawlessly perfect that its hard to stand up against that level of perfection...anyway..with that said...i have no idea why they took off the great rock version and put the disco-fluff version of angel eyes which is hard to find on cd. this to me is really the last roxy music album because you just cant have roxy music without paul thompson...sorry. i mean avalon and the others are nice pieces but they really should have been bryan ferry solo albums because andy and phil are really playing more as session players there ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive
 etta never fails to deliver in the vocals. gutteral bombast sweet soul gospel blues the lady is a living legend. but this album like the last album produced by her son is a nightmare. chessy arrangments tinkly bass poor sound all around. she is a fierce mother and i'm sure she thinks her kids know best but there is a reason why labels pair vocalists with the right producer. should etta get the chance to work with a fresh ear at the deck she wouldn't need the novelty of some of the song choices. ps - 200lbs lighter and she remains the best live performer; blues r/b soul whatever in the world. ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative

 if this is to truly be gybe's last piece of work then they've concluded their brief and dynamic catalog on a fitting note. while i still believe lift yr. skinny fists... is their masterwork yanqui is easily a close second. where fists had a broader range of sounds and textures - elements of sacred and profane - yanqui is more balanced and focused. although you could argue this point i think yanqui never gets as high or low as fists. the sound on yanqui is entirely consistent with their previous releases. as other reviewers mentioned the only major change is the absence of field recordings which actually helps to distinguish this album as the finale. the lack of human voice adds a new aura of mystery to the work. well there is actually another surprising moment on this album: it happens during a movement about halfway into the album. the guitars drop off leaving only a small ensemble playing dissonant woodwinds over a steady tribal percussion. for a few minutes it definitely doesn't sound like typical gybe. in fact the dissonant horns sound almost like a ligeti composition (although ligeti probably wouldn't have used a steady rhythm of any kind). fear not. not only does it work but it swells nicely into a full band tidal wave. but here's the most important point i want to make about yanqui: to me it resolves some of the musical themes fists introduced which makes u.x.o. a fitting conclusion. the last bit on mfer=redeemer p.1 slows way down featuring one guitar with one violin (i think) playing together in fragile harmony along with some distortion in the background. when i listen to this i can't help but think of the very beginning of fists except the melody changes just enough to resolve the paranoia that the fists melody introduced. in other words it's like i can hear gybe - at last - acknowledging that there does exist some...hope!...some goodness!....some peace!...in this world - the very place that's inspired them to make such dissonant music. and well if gybe can slow down and acknowledge something hopeful exists well then hope must exist. indeed mother****er does = redeemer. of course they give us one last act on yanqui just to kick our butts one final time. yes it gets so out of control that at one point the siren that's blaring in the background seems appropriate. the very end i love as it builds and builds and builds with distortion and droning until the music finally-- it suddenly ends. yanqui u.x.o. is possibly the final act in a brief but brilliant catalog. it's an awesome finale ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative
 if you were lucky enough to buy the soundtrack when first released in 1987 on enigma records hang on to that out of print gem! straight to hell is back on cd as straight to hell returns and may have a lot more tracks this time but it also deleted two tracks from the original release and shortens another track. not appearing this time are: the good the bad and the ugly by the pogues and my personal favorite money guns and coffee by pray for rain. the track the killers by pray for rain ran 2 minutes 55 seconds on the original but on this new release was shortened to only 2 minutes. this is rather perplexing considering straight to hell returns runs a total of 55 minutes 7 seconds which would have left room for those other tracks to be included (since cds can run a total of 79 minutes 59 seconds). i'm deducting a point from my rating of this cd because the missing tracks should have been included! on the plus side this new release contains a lot of short instrumental tracks from the film that were not on the original cd release in 1987 as well as some brief dialogue excerpts. the film was a misunderstood classic and the soundtrack of spaghetti western-style rock is wonderful: the pogues joe strummer pray for rain zander schloss elvis costello's macmanus gang and even dialogue excerpts from courtney love before she was well i guess the word is famous. if you're a fan of any of these artists you'll love this assortment of songs...those not familiar with the film may not be able to absorb the atmosphere these songs and instrumentals create so get the film on dvd and you'll appreciate the works of these artists so much more. the liner notes claim this cd is to be considered the official soundtrack while the first release of it back in 1987 was basically a souvenir. i enjoy both releases immensely but since i was listening to those other deleted tracks for nearly 20 years now it's sad to not hear them this time around ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
 i ordered this cd based on the reviews. first i have to say that i am not sure why it is called 'paris under a groove'. i was thinking that it would be in french at least. the beats are nice i would not in any way compare it to buddha bar.. i just wasn't as thrilled as i thought that i would be. it sounded very cheap. no originality. my fiancee is from paris and this was very disappointing- not only to him- but i was embarrassed as offering it as a present....so far it sits on the shelf.. ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 i admit to being curious about rihanna's music because like a previous poster from brooklyn stated i was not trying to become a rihanna fan!!. i was really pleasantly surprised by the quality of this disc and although rihanna is no vocal powerhouse the songs on the disc were produced in such a way as to mask this fact and create more than a few enjoyable songs. i really loved her lead single pon de replay and since i don't listen to the radio it never grew old to me because i heard it so infrequently. it's almost an instantly classic dance track with its hypnotic beats & fun lyrics. the other standout tracks to me are: here i go again - like the island beats of the music and again her vocals are utilized well on the track willing to wait - more of a straight r&b track with great beats that again work well with her vocals let me - has an interesting go-go beat mixed with a middle eastern sound rush - again a great dance track it's unfortunate that her vocal skills are so slight because there are 2 ballads that although featuring very pretty music production ultimately fail as singles because she is such a weak vocalist: the last time - rihanna attempts vocal runs that are way out of her league and now i know - although she has moments where her voice sounds pretty this song would've been a big hit for a stronger singer. honestly i'd recommend this disc to others who are curious about rihanna's music and to those who like ashanti - ultimately they are cut from the same cloth as artists. they are able to produce enjoyable singles (through the magic of protools) but don't do much in the way of live vocal performances ,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative
 this will be short. it is worth the price of this album just to hear the branford and harry connick jr. duet carolina shout. that being said all of the other tracks on this album are excellent. from jungle blues to doug wamble's solo guitar on autumn lamp with this record you get a pile of blues and at the same time gain an appreciation for romare breaden's art. a must have. branford keeps outdoing himself ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 the four seasons have always been one of my favorite groups. i think frankie valli has one of the best voices in the world and without the doubt the greatest falsetto in existence and the rest of the group had harmonies that only the beach boys could match. nd for band that has had as any hits as them are destined to have a barrage of greatst hits collection. up until now i always felt the best way to obtain all the four seasons' best songs was by getting rhino's single disc the very best of the four seasons. well i was wrong. in season: the frankie valli and the 4 seasons anthology is the definitve four seasons collection. on these two discs you find all the essential four seasons songs including sherry big girls don't cry walk like a man dawn (go away) rag doll let's hang on (to what we've got) working my way back to you opus 17 (don't you worry 'bout me) tell it to the rain (an often forgotten top 10 hit and my favorite four seasons song ever) who loves you and december 1963 (oh what a night). but the majority of the cd is a wealth of rarities including many songs that were either album tracks uncharted singles or frankie vali solo singles. plus you get it for about $25.00 which i consider fairly cheap for a cd with 51 songs. the 30+ page booklet is excellent filled with track information (chart positions etc.) rare photos and an excellent essay written by pat sierchio. this is an absolute must have ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 most other reviewers listed here believe that this cd is good - i wonder if the fantastic and marvelous nature of the legendary mannheim concerts and the joyous nature of earlier mannheim cd's have made it difficult to critique a mannheim offering! i am a student of all sorts of music and have been my entire life - and this particular cd sounded to me like one long track of exactly the same music just with different chords. in fact if i was not paying specific attention i couldn't tell when one song ended and another started! i enjoyed what i heard but i was certainly expecting more from this cd - many of these disney songs could have easily lent themselves to more spectacular stylings - at the very least some variety seems to have been called for. disney has always included great music with their movies running the gamut of musical styles such as classical jazz blues and even hip-hop - so maybe my problem was that my expectations were too high. i do however highly recommend mannheim cd's in general - just not this one ,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative
 i can honestly say that when i first heard scarling's so long scarecrow i was less than impressed. i've been into scarling for a few years now and when i heard their first recordsweet heart dealer i instantly fell in love. i somewhat held it above everything else i was so impressed by it. so when i heard the progression from shd to sls i was a little bit let down. but after three solid listens from first to last i was totally amazed by this record. it was like something clicked and i was able to see the beauty each track held. i seriously listen to this cd almost everyday. although i prefer some tracks to others [(northbound on) cauhenga!] i really can't think of one track that i just don't like. it now takes place in my favorites over shd. i feel that this record can really appeal to anyone; it's very versatile. and as always jessicka's beautiful vocals compliment the indescribable amazingness of the music wonderfully. if you're indecisive about purchasing this record i say bite the bullet give it a few solid listens and promptly be blown away ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative
 this was one of the most dissappointing debut albums to come out of the mid nineties g-funk heyday. warren g. didn't even produce one song on this sorry attempt at making hard/soft gangsta rap except for the title track that was already used on his album a year before. the skits are ridiculous the music is halfass and the lyrics are amateur. there is absolutely nothing that keeps the listener's attention for a whole album. this is similar to other west coast rap albums that play it too safe such as w.c. and the madd circle's debut and coolio's it takes a thief. one star for the hit single summertime in the l.b.c.. ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 when this album first came out i felt jilted. but i recently had an oppertunity to listen to it for what it is and i think its a great album. make no mistake if you're a die-hard 80's rocker you'll hate this album. the production is raw and the songwriting is lean and mean as opposed to elaberate and detailed. but that doesn't mean that the musicianship is lacking on this record. if you can keep an open mind i think this ablum is one that you'll love ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 i first encountered bird3 opening for veruca salt the summer of 2001. that band had put their faith into bird and so have i. we fell in love with them all together. this band has successfully combined infectious pop hooks with soul-baring lyrics to create something unique beautiful and far from most of the trite pop or rock music you hear on the radio today. you'll find yourself not only humming along but holding this music close to your heart at your most intimate moments. you will not once regret buying this piece of art ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive
 i get the sense that the fleetwoods'body of recorded work isn't given the respect it deserves. over the course of their career the trio recorded thirteen albums and yet this collection as good as it is is pretty much all that's out there on cd save for a few other compilations that cover much of the same ground. rock and roll has always had a soft side and it's in this area that the fleetwoods really shine. their cover of thomas wayne's &quot;tragedy&quot; is an evocative slice of 1961 teen angst-i can't put it any other way. maybe that's the reason why the fleetwoods are given short shrift today: they're the perfect embodiment of a (then)nascent teen culture's soft and gentle side.this collection features all of their hits some well chosen album tracks and the original pre-overdub version of &quot;come softly to me&quot;. if you like this recording try looking for their original lps.

 carlos mencia is one edgy comedian; i know this because he won't stop telling everyone about it. i've never been a huge fan of carlos and after listening to this cd my opinion of him hasn't really changed. he claims to be an edgy comedian and that's his problem if he was truly edgy he wouldn't have to constantly remind us in his cd/dvd titles his show on comedy central radio/tv interviews and most importantly during his own act. sure he talks about very racial and socially taboo subjects but so does chris rock george lopez david cross george carlin dave chappelle richard pryor (rip) and countless other comedians and they are much better at it. in fact they are so good at it mr. mencia often feels to need to use some of these comedian's jokes in his own act a true sign of respect for those who came before them; at least that's what carlos seems to think or maybe he's just plagiarizing because he's not funny enough to come up with descent material. needless to say i was not laughing while listening to this cd and it wasn't because i find carlos to mean spirited or crass or politically incorrect; it's because everything he talks about that's supposed to be so gosh darn edgy has already been said by other people who are much more funny then he is. there is so much good stand up comedy out there people don't waste your time and money on this joke stealing self aggrandizing hack. ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive

 i can't for the life of me understand the appeal or better the necessity for the black crowes. to call all the riffs recycled is to give them credit for originality they don't possess...there's nothing here that hasn't been done better with more creativity and feeling and of course originality by the stones faces et al...and it's not a valid counter-argument that the stones stole from the great blues masters because of course they did...but what they also did is add some value something of their own that was completely fresh...what these guys have done is the aural equivalent of sewing a new name tag on.. ,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative
 i know i know - i never thought it possible either that gwen stefani could produce something more awful than anything her (ex?) band no doubt and reduced to house-husband gavin rosdale's band bush ever could combined. take no doubt's attempts at reggae their use of guitars and trumpets (together? never good) take.. well every bush song ever recorded and hollaback girl is still a hundred times worse. let's talk about why. first of all that fake music thing i hate. if you've read any of my previous reviews (and if not why not?) you'll know that if someone is singing something even if they've written it or not you've got to believe it. i mean aretha franklin didn't write respect (otis redding did) but when she sings it - you believe it. not so with this a laughable attempt at a football-chant soundalike. here gwen tells us that uh-huh this my s**t and this s**t is bananas. and then helpfully spells out bananas all under a hey mickey type repetitive drumbeat. gwen attempts to sound a number of things.. a) 17 b) black c) street d) like she had any idea what the hell a hollaback girl actually was until someone told her a week before the song was written. she fails on all accounts. what she does come across as being is everything that well she is. a white 35 year old rich married woman bringing in expensive young talent to help her sell albums. it's not only an unconvinving song but a crass ugly tedious noise. but it has the word s**t repeated loads and loads of times so of course it sold by the bucketload. sigh and double sigh. i shudder to think what she'll come up with next to top it. gwen gangsta rap? the_curmudgeon_hates_you@yahoo.co.u ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 i went into this a pretty big golden smog fan eager for a new effort from the guys. with tweedy's songwriting having taken a great upward swing in recent years and with louris' departure from the jayhawks i was hoping we'd see a few more tweedy gems and some great tunes from the past few years since louris' rainy day music was released. now while there are some really good songs here nothing really comes close to the red-headed stepchilds radio kings or jennifer save mes. the album lacks something but i can't put my finger on it. it almost sounds like a band that has too much focus. considering golden smog started as a buncha musician friends sitting around drinking beer and goofing off this album feels wrong. it doesn't have that sing-along feel (with the exception of possibly one or two songs) that the first couple albums (and even ep) had. just a little lackluster and considering the amount of louris has his hand in on this one almost comes off as an album of jayhawks throw-aways ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 i bought this in a haze of holiday optimism having heard ms. aguilera knock my socks off dueting with tony bennett on a television tribute show. there is no denying that the girl can sing. unfortunately what she sings here is banal at best and downright irritating at worst--lots of gratuitous squealing. it's a real shame to see a talent like hers drowned by the tide of pop mediocrity. i reluctantly gave this two stars rather than one in recognition of my age. maybe i just don't get it. then again maybe it's just not there for me to get ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative
 it was about time the spell kasey chambers originally cast on me wore off - i'd become a huge fan of the captain and barricades & brickwalls but there was all something a little nagging about even those two very good records. chambers a unique betty boop squeak of a voice was a lustrous presence in rootsy contexts and the best moments of those records were snarky updates on an old form but the worst moments were forgettable alt-country duldrums of patched together cliches. wayward angel chambers' third album had some great songs on it but its pop and country predictability overtook a good half of the album. carnival shows chambers at her weakest - sad girl anthems of generic empowerment about the rain bad girl anthems of doin-wrong that sound about as risky as songs on the disney channel's afternoon lineup. light up a candle fakes its slinkiness and turns dull surrender adds a dido production of drum machines and computer bleeps that don't mask the song's epic ordinariness ballads like dangerous limp along to their own generic lethargy. chambers isn't without charm - sign on the door and i got you now are impossible to not find fun - yet chambers worst instincts as a song writer threaten to take over even the good songs - hard road a sad and moving movie-ready duet borders on self-parody - lines like there's a heavy jacket/ there's a heavy load/ there's a weight on my shoulders/ it's a hard road read like a laundry list of related lines from every sad and moving movie-ready song you've ever heard ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative
 unlike most other items i've bought from amazon i failed to read the reviews for this particular cd before purchasing. being a fan of the final fantasy series i think i fell into a bit of the fanboy (well in my case fangirl i guess) syndrome. also i didn't do my homework at all and thought this was an orchestrated recording which it most certainly is not. i own most of the final fantasy ost's (and heartily endorse them for fans of the games) and this particular cd does nothing new or compelling to the music. tracks 1-7 are pretty much carbon copies of their ost counterparts. track 8 the opening theme of ffviii (liberi fatali) has a very odd synth-solo vocal mix covering what is in the original a very moving choral section. tracks 9-11 again are basically copies of the ost. track 12 alexandria (vivi's theme) is the only somewhat-original track as it seems to put together several pieces from the ffix soundtrack in a medley of sorts. unless you are a rabid fan who must have everything ff i recommend saving up and purchasing the real ost's instead of this disc. while i don't see non-fans flocking to purchase this disc it might be worthwile if you're only slightly interested in the series and want a taste. even in that event i'd be worried this disc would turn those people off from the series entirely. pros: cheap (i paid $6 new) track 12 is worth a listen cons: tracks 1-7 9-11 offer nothing much new or different track 8 has creepy (in a bad way) synth/voice mixe ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 ok i've listened to fat boy slim. that guy's stuff isn't bad by no means main stream but worth while. but ... this norman cook - he's horrible. it's no wonder cook developed an alter ego. with the exception of a few easily recognisable tunes i couldn't believe this &quot;stuff&quot; had come from the same artist that produced praise you. renegade master is the type of track i've come to know and respect (that one is a keeper) and i have to give props for i left my wallet in el segundo. other than that this album sounds like someone mixed songs from the first dozen records they found during their expedition to the flea market. if this is the sound you're looking for save a few bucks check out your local yard sales. so as not to be too negative i'll say this; the printing job on the cd itself is charming. the notion of making it look like a turntable was inspired ,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative

 i just love this cd. over 8 years ago my much older coworker turned me onto this album. it is definetly not just for st paddy's day. this is an album you can listen to over and over. the sinead songs are a bit whiney but she does have an excellent voice. you can not get better that mic and sting. sting's song is just incredible. ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative
 this album is simply one of the coolest things around and when i listened to it it inspired me to a similar project using the same 'weaving and zoning from place to place' kind of method. what this basically is are field recordings of various different indigenous and mainstream musics from mostly indian/middle eastern/oriental festivals; they are then mixed together nicely into one flowing peice. you get indian gamelan mussette accordion vocal choruses foreign tongue talking and psychadelic bagpipes all in one 33 minute track and then some. it's very trippy and it hints at some kind of endless dream where we flow from place to place without reason. get this for your own good ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 what has happened to the song lives in the balance on this set? if you go to his website it sounds really great!!! on this set it sounds awfull!! it sounds as if he was in a really big hurry to get the song over with. the packaging if you could call it that is really lame. foam dots for holders? what do you do when those fall off? i suppose you put the cd's in jewel cases or else they will get really scratched up. not to mention it is missing some of his greatest work! true you do get alot of songs for the money but there should have been more time planning this set out before actually producing it. if you own an i-pod i suggest you go to apples i-tunes web page and import the great songs this set is missing as well as the others you really like off of this set and you will probably have spent the same amount of money if not less ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative
 i remember thinking when this film came out that few things in life were as cool as lloyd dobler. this soundtrack is also one of those things. this album for me as for many i'm sure somewhat reflected my taste in music at the time and even now actually. of course the biggie here is in your eyes from peter gabriel. who hasn't that track touched at some point? this also confirmed my love for the red hot chili peppers and here we get a slightly extended version of their classic taste the pain. toss on a few from fishbone living colour and the replacements and you solidify this soundtrack as a must own for the late 80's alt-rock lover. not to mention the goods from depeche mode and nancy wilson (heart). in fact the only thing that could've made this album any better is if it ended with a ding ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive

 this outstanding effort by prince consists of mostly spare jazzy r&b tunes driven by incredibly loose free-flowing live instrumentation. i could only begin to tell you about the stylistic variety on this album. with the three disc format there is a lot to absorb and the third disc really can largely be done without but the first two truly do rank amongst his best work. it should also be noted how especially romantic prince is on this album. this album was made around the time that he entered into his first marriage and it shows because this c.d. is overflowing with outstanding romantic ballads. most of his albums only contain one or two ballads so if you've been longing for an album that includes more then this album should really appeal to you. this c.d. does not fit into the standard prince mold ( i know that it is perhaps a bit oxymoronic to speak of a prince mold but his personal signature is not quite as bold on this album as it is on many of his other works even those that are admittedly not as good). the reason for this is that prince follows rather than leads on a good portion of this album. the fact that there are two covers on the first disc alone shows that prince was in the mood to do what was being done instead of doing something new (he covers songs by bonnie raitt and the stylistics) which is unsual for this constant innovator but this album is so great because he is so skillful that he does it better than almost anyone else. one minor problem that i notice is that it seems that on a few songs particularly on the first disc prince just doesn't pay much attention to the lyrics. there are too many generic r&b come-ons and cheesy cliche 90's catch phrases such as gettin' your groove on' and prince is much too clever witty and creative to resort to such things. but really that is just a minor quibble because the music truly is consistently outstanding throughout the first two discs. and then he has songs such as soul sanctuary and let's have a baby which are two of the most well-written ballads that i've heard from him. in this bed i scream is just magnificent both lyrically and musically. he takes the lead again on this track and he does it in a major way. this clever poetic and romantic track has an infectiously catchy both rhythm and melody that would easily pack any dance floor. other highly impressive moments include the high powered funk of we gets up the absolutely brilliant and stunning arrangement on curious child and the sincere pure passion of the just so perfect r&b/gospel blend of savior. joint 2 joint is impressive just for having so much variety in terms of sounds and elements with each part so effectively enhancing a different part of the story. the first two discs are really solid overall. the third disc however finds prince trying his hand at techno and other forms of conventional dance/club music and the results are not very impressive. but i don't see how they could be even coming from prince. techno for the most part is insanely repetitive monotonous and downright drone-like. there are only three songs on disc three that were really worth it (slave my computer and the title track). well maybe four his cover of la la (means i love you) is actually really good too. those songs could have been put on the first two discs and the 3rd disc really could have been omitted. the most impressive feat that he manages to accomplish on this entire album is making a great chorus and a great song out of the line www 'dot' emale `dot' com on emale :-). i was unaware of this feat for a while because i used to always skip this song because it started off with that really annoying 90's g-funk whistle. so overall this album really does rank amongst prince's best work and it should especially appeal to those who would like to see him do more ballads and dive into more r&b ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative

 yes she has a great voice but this entire cd is so overproduced so lifeless so very boring that i had to force myself to listen to the entire thing - searching desperately for a track that measures up to the voice. she sounds as bored as i was on every song. i hope she wakes up soon before we all fall asleep ,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative
 i bought this cd for hole in the earth a very dynamic driving and quasi-psychedelic rocker and mostly got what i expected - more of the same along a continuum sometimes pushing their envelope in either direction as i expected. and then i came upon pink cellphone a rotten apple if there ever was one. this vile little stinker is as if one of the band's groupies wandered into the control room in a methamphetamine haze defecated on the mixing board and then described her experience in no uncertain terms into an answering machine. if there was ever a reason to switch from buying an artist's complete cds to just purchasing individual tracks off of the web this is it. congratulations guys you have not only lodged a very descriptive and literally filthy image into my head but convinced me and i'd wager many listeners that our faith is ill placed with the musical choices that pop musicians make when assembling their b sides. to say nothing of the bad taste and lack of respect for your audience that this demonstrates. someone should wash the deftones' mouths out with a bar of soap - maybe a few bars. ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 although a couple of reviews said this was a great product i was wary as i have never found anything that actually worked. i have a job where my mind is always on the go and often have a week or two a month where i just can't get to sleep. the cd arrived during one of these times i put it on my portable cd player not expecting too much and almost imediately felt a bit queazy nothing too bad and on later research this basically proves the delta wave theory dr. thompson is working. the only time in the past when i have gone to sleep so easily when i have been out partying all night when i was younger. i play the cd on a stereo i have in my room and i rarely wake up at all. i am certainly going to buy more of his cd's ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 the coltrane soundscapes that this cd is infused flies to the mountain and back again that's the truth but one troubling question for me remains; no matter how much i enjoy this fusion incarnation by masters (new & old) - where in the world is alan holdsworth? if any fusion guitar player has the rightful title claim to the coltrane moniker - it's holdsworth. for years he's been building the bridge between the good old philosophies and the new world order. including holdsworth would have just been the jazziest thing to do. ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 there is nothing more intimate then the human voice. i am a voice major at a university. nothing speaks to me more highly then choral music. i was a little skeptical about this cd when i first got it. i have since fallen in love with every aspect of it. of course if you get this cd you must get the companion cd lux aeterna by the los angeles master chorale. you cannot have one without the other ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative

 i love this soundtrack! it stands alone as beautiful haunting alluring and innocent--just as griet herself was in the film. desplat perfectly captured the spirit of the story enhanced and deepened a plot that was less than stellar. scarlett johanssen's acting is superb as well as essie davis and colin firth. the story though was a bit tired--pretty housemaid/jealous wife/do-nothing husband. its portrayal of vermeer and his wife was a disservice to the real people even though it is a fictionalized account. the two best tracks on this album are 'griet's theme' and 'colours in the clouds'. while i'm not keen on seeing the film again this soundtrack is a treasure. it's a real work of art second only to vermeer's work ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative
 i was at the brighton concerts that these recordings were mostly taken from and as a reminder of two stunning nights of music they can't be better. standout tracks include the two by martha wainwright the two by teddy thompson perla batalla's bird on a wire rufus' chelsea hotel and (from the sydney concert) antony's if it be your will. two major disappointments though; the inclusion of u2 as backing band for leonard cohen's own version of tower of song seems done for purely commercial reasons and doesn't work and the nonsensical ommission of linda thompson's sublime take on alexandra leaving. here's hoping it's included on the dvd release ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative

 there is at times a fine line between noise and music. nin not only crossed that line in this cd but stomped on it a few times in the process. not even close to the calibre of with teeth this cd is a waste of time and an insult to the talent that resides within this group of musicians. songs that go from semi-music to irritating noise and last four times as long as one can abide while playing the same thing over and over and ...well you get my drift. if great music is your thing pass this one up. or write me a note and tell me why on earth such a great group would release such an abomination ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 like i said i would i finally got around to purchasing this cd. i especially like tracks 9-12. cheap trick is solid as always. i have been a long time fan and enjoy all their releases. if i do have any criticism at all it is the fact that some songs sound like recycled trick riffs. i guess it's hard to create new stuff after 30+ years. anyway there are some great tunes on this. buy it like i did! ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative

 not his best stuff. he's running short of lyrical ideas he recycles his own lines like star wars recycles i have a bad feeling about this. beats are usually cool i don't care for the popish tracks with the singing. i didn't mind it so much when he sang really bad back on his first album but now it's no longer funny it sounds like pop. anyhow organized religion is crap. i thought krs understood this back in the day. what happened? now he's got his own little organization and his own little phylosophy and his only little diciples and crap i dunno it's posative but then again it's gay like some of his modern tracks. anyhow it is cheap if you have to finish off your collection as i do then buy it otherwise go buy his anything boombap on back. or check out: kool keith el-p gang starr mr. lif jedi miind tricks public enemy non phixion sir menelik most of which is better than krs' latest works ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 i am a huge fan of elvis costello and ran to the shop as soon as i read the great reviews of this album what a mistake!!! very few of the arrangements offer an improvement over the original version. the cardboard cut salsa montuno of 'clubland' sounds as classy and natural as a plastic flamingo and the wonderful ska sound of 'watching the detectives' is lost in a jazz arrangement that doesn't offer much to the melody. elvis' voice is not suited the long sustained notes of 'almost blue' and most of the songs. it worked well on his 'juliet letters' album because the brodsky quartet played for his style but with the clean and crisp sound of the metropole orkest it is just painful. for me'hora decubitus' is the only song worth listening from this musical jumble ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative
 miss saigon is my favorite all-time musical! i was hesitant when buying this recording because in my mind lea salonga is and always will be kim! but i was pleasantly surprised. joanna ampil as kim holds her own. while she doesn't have the vocal range of lea she has a beautiful crisp voice which she uses to emote the emotional turmoil of kim. she expresses herself in a way that makes you feel her love pain and anguish and in turn she makes this part her own. the rest of the cast is superb (especially the amazing ruthie henshall as ellen) but make no mistake this show belongs to ampil! i also fell in love with some of the material left out of the lcr. there a beautiful bridges and songs which enrich the story. back in town stands out for me because of the gorgeous melodies. anyone who has fallen in love with the story of miss saigon will appreciate these added gems! this cast recording is definitely worth a listen! ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 one word. generic. terrible. boring. (well they are all one word) people must learn to have a better taste in music. granted there is at least one good song. a few others are decent but only because there are no vocals. if you have heard any new band for the last 3 years you have heard pulse ultra. my friend likes breaking binjaman (another uber generic rock band in my book) and he listened to 2 songs from pulse ultra and said thats enough. do yourself a favor and buy a good cd. when will people learn! ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive

 on the liner notes to one of the two blues albums (i think it is shaker) it is said that the original idea was just to perform some of these songs in a one night concert. that should have been as far as it went. to foist these songs on an unsuspecting public at 19 bucks a crack is highway robbery. if these are blues songs then i am robert johnson's illegitimate son. death letter is good maybe even great but cannot compare to the original or to any of the covers i have previously heard. the rest is a waste of time. the cover art is excellent but hardly the reason you would be expected to buy the cd. these are my first 2 reviews by the way but all these 5-star reviews for both cd's finally got me motivated. go buy a muddy waters or lightning hopkins cd and save 10 bucks in the bargain ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 this album is way overated let me tell you why. wack mc: mf doom is a bad rapper not the worst just bad. he can flow but his rymes are weak corny and somtimes it doesnt make sense at all. the corniest ryme i heard was- we rock the house like rock 'n roll/ got more soul than a sock with a hole. lmao! it gets worse take it from the tec-9 holder/ they bit and dont know they neck shine from shinola what is he talking about??? he is not a genius mc nas is he is even worse than aesop rock. which they rap with words and dont even make any sense. filler: this cd has too much filler they have like 10 songs that last only 50 secs. some of them is not even neccasary. average beats: the beats are either average or just sucks. i can make better beats on fruity loops. however track 22 rhinestone cowboy had the best beat on the entire album. the beat was hot to tell you the truth but that only gives it one star. overall this album sucks just download rhinestone cowboy and call it a day. i think madlib can make good beats its just that he didnt show it here. i dont recommend this album if you want a good album get mos def black on both sides it 10x better than this ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive

 afi used to be a pretty good band. then they decided to go emo-girlie-boy. the lead singer has made adramatic change from smelly-goth-dude to perfect-manicured-emo-girl/guy. what happened to smeely-goth-dude? some of us actually like the music not the emoness. not only that but miss murder was waaaaay overplayed and now it is encrested into my brain. i mean come on it's not even that good of a song. afi is looking to appeal to the mainstream. there's nothing wrong with that if you keep your old sound which this band has failed to do. this my friends is afi's worst album if not hte worst album of 2006. check out the older afi stuff. sing the sorrow is okay but if you want truley good music you have to go back into their ninties albums ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 sometimes debut albums present an artist in full bloom with an assured grasp on their sound and message. sometimes debut albums are nothing but promise pointing toward what the artist could do. public enemy's gripping first album yo! bum rush the show manages to fill both categories: it's an expert fully realized record of extraordinary power but it pales in comparison with what came merely a year later. this is very much a rick rubin-directed production kicking heavy guitars toward the front honing the loops rhythms and samples into a roar with as much in common with rock as rap. but damn if they don't sound like they've already conquered the world! already there is a tangible physical excitement to the music something that hits the gut with relentless force as the mind races to keep up with chuck's relentless rhymes or flavor flav's spastic outbursts. and if there doesn't seem to be as many classics here -- you're gonna get yours miuzi weighs a ton public enemy no. 1 -- that's only in comparison to what came later since by any other artist an album this furious visceral and exciting would unquestionably be heralded as a classic. from public enemy this is simply a shade under classic status ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive

 maiden voyage appears on innumerable lists of jazz masterpieces and it is clear from the first listen that both the composition and the playing are at a level of technical proficiency unmatched on most albums of this era or any time afterward. nevertheless the finished product is not one that all listeners will find appealing. to these ears this album seems aimless and even somewhat annoying. the songs meander without clear structure and tony williams' drumming seems at times to be going in a direction opposite that of the rest of the band. the influence of this album is indisputable but its enjoyability is a more subjective matter. if you enjoy groundbreaking cerebral jazz such as the music made by miles davis' second quintet then this album will probably work for you. if on the other hand you favor hancock's earlier and more accessible albums takin' off and my point of view this album may be a bit of a letdown ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 while some would call orange and acme studio albums suggesting that they lack originality but they have rythm. i would call myself a big jsbx fan i play orange and acme constantly however i feel that this album is a little too much free form and free noise for the everyday listener. i would recommend that anyone interested in jsbx start with acme and then move on to orange to develop an appreciation for jsbx because it is a rather acquired taste ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 certainly this album offers very little to a fan of the ocean blue's eariler work. the vocals and guitars sound quite different (gone is that beautiful dreamy sound). and what about those awesome saxaphone and keyboard sounds that made their earlier tracks so fun? just because steve lau is gay is no reason for the band to abandon keyboards altogether. so anyway what does this album offer instead? harder sounding guitar angrier sounding vocals and songs that are somewhat intersting but are lacking in any magic that would make you want to listen to them after you've had the cd for a couple weeks. exceptions: &quot;whenever you're around&quot; and &quot;slide&quot; are good enough songs to standout inspite of boring production ,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative
 the first time i read this book was at the age of 13. my mother had an old worn 1950s copy of the book on our bookshelf and one day i just decided to give it a try. i think the first 50 pages were a bit of a mystery to me. i remember struggling with the language at the beginning and having to look up several words in the dictionary. after 100 pages i had finally learnt the language and managed to at last translate it into my native tongue. i enjoyed it and over the years i returned to it again and again. now at the age of 35 i practically have numerous passages memorized and reading the book is no longer a culture shock. every word of this novel is an old friend and i wouldn't remove a single one from the text. this is the book i turn to when i'm in the mood to read but not in the mood to read something new. every time i read it i am struck by its relevance. i don't mean the morals or the need to marry well in order to win approval from society (although i think we still see a little of that to this day). i refer to the characters. their personalities and basic code of principals are timeless. i can identify with every single character in this novel. when lizzy and mr. darcy fell in love their courtship could have taken place anywhere and at any point in time. that is why her novels are so well adapted into modern films. you cannot possibly do wrong by reading this novel ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 i had been hearing always thinking of you. but i never got who it was. i purchased xm radio and on the smooth jazz channel i heard the cut again and got the artist name. purchased the cd based on that one cut. every cut is great on this cd. i look forward to catching him live at some point and will continue to look for more from him in the future. he has his own style. but not only do you hear hints of benson and brown..........i hear a little doc powell as well. i will be introducing friends to this great artist............keep it coming............ ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 this album made me realize that darn record company produces for examle two regular albums; two best albums; two tribute albums; and finally two mixture of everything under a sounds-like-new-but-actually-an-old albums from a musician. this is an example of the mixture of previously released re-released at last over-released best tracks with a sounds-like-regular album title. let me tell you one thing. jp is dead and gone since rob left the band. i doubt there will be more regular jp albums but you'll have plenty of compilations like this coming out until you stop buying ,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative

 this cd is boring and derivative to the point of being cynical. a better alternative would be to listen to either: a) the original artists who influenced this band or b) someone at least trying to do something new with music. to enjoy this cd you'd have to really want to like this band either because you liked dig or because you're attracted to their super-cool reputation. if you're afraid you're missing out on something by not owning bjm's back catalogue don't worry you're not. ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 i don't own this cd. i don't have to own it to review it because this music is the soundtrack of my high school years. i lived this music. i listened to it while cruising the local shopping center indulging in - er - various activities. half of the bands on this cd i had the privilege of seeing perform live in the 70s. this is what fm radio sounded like back then. every single song on this cd was well known to me and my friends. yes even black oak arkansas (hot and nasty!) nazareth (get hair of the dog cd for more) and the runaways (hot babes!). oh and i love the movie too. party on dudes ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative

 i could not wait to get this album. i usually love to hear the new the hypnotize minds albums. however after so many years groups do make mistakes. this is a major one. chrome could suck his name off of a trailer hitch. i own the original copies of every prophet/hypnotize relese since mystic styles and this is by far the worst to emerge. they never release a lord infamous solo album in 12 years (not to mention he is dj paul's brother...wait i just did) and now this??? what's next a crunchy black album lol?? this is a personal note to dj paul and juicy j...please swallow your pride and re-hire (at least) t-rock gangsta boo mc mack and bribe some judges to get lord infamous out of jail!!! p.s.- this only gets 2 stars for the production value. ,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,positive
 another torrent of mild tripe from everyone's favourite dj tiesto. what on earth is he going to do when the supply of inane pastel-coloured eurovomit dance music runs out? when i think about the number of times i've heard him touted as world's number one best voted dj or dj mag top 100 finalist you'd start to think that the man can actually mix records when in fact rather than mix them he tends to grind them together roughly into a nightmarish aural paste then reconfigure them violently in new unusual and horrendously nauseating forms. i can absolutely confirm this. i have had the startling and displeasing experience of witnessing it live. the sad truth of the matter is that there are any number of drug-addicted fluoro-pants-wearing 16 year old ravers out there and all are quite willing to buy boring rubbish like this. or at least all are prepared to ask their mum and dad to buy it for them for xmas. i sign off in disgust ,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 i have been following gospel since the early 80s. i am a big fan of contemporary gospel and shei atkins defines how r&p gospel should sound. trinitee 5:7 along with dawkins & dawkins have done a great job so far but shei atkins covers it all--relationships (cheating divorce pre-marital sex); worship; hymns; enocuragement; you name it and she has a song for it. i just bought the cd and i can't take it out of my cd player!! her voice is so annointed and unique! she can easily give beyonce erykah badu and mary blige a run for their money! she can easily be played on mainstream radio and everyone would be bobbin' their heads to it--yet she has no problem mentioning jesus in any of her songs! for those christians who are looking for something that they can groove and relax too (with some anointing) please buy this cd--i promise you that you won't be disappointed! i can literally listen to every song on this cd over and over again ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative
 &quot;modern&quot; usually sounds like some outdated mid-80s new wave album by the cars flock of seagulls or somesuch. it is not a punk record mostly midtempo pop. the three songs diggle wrote and sings on are basically awful; shelley's are considerably better - the usual wry lyrics and great hooks. i would say about 3 or 4 of the tunes are topnotch buzzcocks stuff; newbies should buy &quot;operator's manual&quot; or &quot;going steady.&quot; or dig up the amazing &quot;different kind of tension&quot; from a used record store somewhere! also see them live if you have a chance ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative
 like the backstreet boys (essentially the same band) and brittany spears (their female solo artist - and i use the term loosely- equivalent) nsync represented all that went wrong with the music world in the '90's. sure there have been completely commercial bands out there for ages but at least groups like the eagles wrote their own material and played their own instruments. not nsync who instead rely on unimaginably boring backing tracks and a stable of professional songwriters who couldn't write a decent tune to save their lives - i bet even their voices were digitally altered. and then there were the inescapable hits - bye bye bye pop it's gonna be me tearin' up my heart et al. that weren't even good the first time around to say nothing of the nine trillionth. no risks taken. no attempts to step out of their winning formula that somehow made this group of no-talents famous. basically this band was thrown together by a bunch of record company chumps who saw five or six guys who wanted to be famous (and probably had never previously met) sent them through the assembly line removed any sense of individuallity or creativity they might've had and dumped them upon the masses who they must've brainwashed or something. i didn't even like this group when i was 10 to say nothing of now. makes you wish zappa was still alive - he'd have a field day with a group like this and undoubtedly dish out some of the funniest insults ever in the process. ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 i just purchased my sacd player and picked up boston and billy joel's the stranger at the same time. after listening to the stranger my mouth dropped. billy's voice coming from the center speaker and all the other instruments and melodies coming from every different direction. then i put in boston and couldn't tell a difference from the cd version i already own. i think it's one of the best albums but if you already own it on cd don't bother upgrading - there's nothing special about the sacd version ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 a tenor very quickly on the rise this is villazon's second recital disc one devoted to arias by gounod and massenet all in sets of three three for massenet and two for gounod. while still showing great promise some concerns that were mildly serious with the first disc are even more so in the french repertoire in part because diction comes up so short here. o souverain from le cid continues to show villazon's command of line and squeezed but adequately forceful upper register so that the volume boosts from the control room are really unnecessary. diction here is already an issue as many `u' vowels get dipthonged especially when villazon's sound is placed back for added weight and volume. `la reve' from massenet's manon is comfortably floated with support from natalie dessay as manon enhancing the intimacy of feeling to this number. would villazon been able to sing the short aria by alain (who appears to the heroine at first to perhaps be little more than an apparition - shades of frau ohne schatten perhaps? - in almost a chamber opera) from massenet's griselidis (track 8) at least as softly and lightly as both the music and dramatic situation require this could have also been very successful. he instead turns the aba shape of this mere chanson inside out and makes a wreck of it. the less often excerpted lorsque enfant from werther closes out the first massenet set as does pourquoi me reveiller the second. villazon's identification with the distraught main character of this opera is abundantly clear in both. he capitalizes well on the quixotic emotions and dreamy tendencies of the distraught main character especially well in the first selection and he is also less intruded upon by the producers or sound engineers there as well. it is quite curious how the control room follows the tenor up a crescendo on a line that closes out the first section of the excerpt here from massenet's roi de lahore featuring a hero (from hindu myth) that bound to certain stipulations has literally returned from the dead. not quite as ostentatious as massenet's near remake of lohengrin esclarmonde (but with female protagonist instead) it is one of massenet's most colorful scores. it has only been recorded complete once commercially with joan sutherland luis lima and appearing only ten minutes apart james morris and for the part of general unfortunately eliminated from this scene here john tomlinson along with one other cut to villazon's part. it would've been more valuable to have all this complete instead of one or two other arias. he captures the incipiently worried tone of alim well but his coloring up the vowel sounds makes it seem that he has come from a place as remote from french culture as where the opera takes place. most successful of the gounod selections are two of the three rarities. the first is source delicieuse from polyeucte based on the corneille play. it opens very well with a minute of orchestral cortege. it perhaps has only been recorded once before and well by roberto alagna ten years ago; villazon conveys the heroism of the piece somewhat well if not as securely as alagna. anges du paradis from mireille (which mirella freni championed and recorded complete for emi) is third perhaps a study for ah leve toi soleil (romeo) several years down the road. the second gounod rarity on this disc is inspirez-moi race divine said to be a caruso favorite from reine de saba. its text indicates king solomon's prize hired builder adoniram to be a very confident if mildly haughty chap. villazon's interpretation seems to portray a hero that constantly has to look behind his back with all the incipiently yet controllably vibrato ridden throb and backphrasing villazon engages in here. the high c at the end however is convincing. such device as in the above also accents and colors most phrasing in the tomb scene from romeo et juliette. ah! leve toi soleil opens the first gounod set and is sung with the right ardor conventionally marked by tiny captured scoops coming off phrases. villazon's entrance and two later lines catch for having placed so far back in the throat and intonation gets momentarily derailed. salut demeure from gounod's faust quickly becomes expressively leaden and monochrome. recitative and the beginning of the aria ah! fuyez from manon begin well nuanced enough and for the aria truly softly as a change from so much else on this disc but all-purpose bench pressing and volume boosts intrude before long. that leaves two truly atmospheric selections from two massenet rarities to close this recital - first an aria from roma massenet's swan song for the lyric theater and ah! parais from le mage opera with plot line similar to that of verdi's aida following. the melody introduced by the cellos at the outset for the latter somewhat takes after pays merveilleux from meyerbeer's africaine but in more voluptuous color such as in thais and villazon and pido both capitalize well on its opulence. pido's work on numerous other numbers on this disc seems heavy lumbering cloying or just simply out of his idiom so to speak. word has it that villazon while not having a big voice is dramatically exciting on stage and probably more immediately engaged with the content of what he is singing. how this picked up a major award from gramophone for the specific problems this disc has and over two more qualified nominations (ciofi/di donato handel duets and a florez album) is mystifying. so much digression here is over the very specific demands that french opera makes on singers. there's much reason for hope for this tenor but this disc for two-thirds of it does little to help fulfill it ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative

 nothing deep by any means but simply a light airy listen with a compilation of quirky tropical tunes. even though the songs (most of them) weren't in the movie they remind me of it of the whole hawaiian atmosphere. my favorite tracks excluding the ones included on the previous cd are blue hawai'i (by elvis) my little grass shack coconut (it's just bizarre but addicting making you smile with absurdity) island in the sun pineapple princess and love me tender. again it's nothing dramatic or swirling but it you adored lilo &amp; stitch (and how can you not?) and all it stood for this cd might just bring some warmth into a cold day. don't think about it. listen and pretend you're there ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 sounds like it should be in a meg ryan romantic comedy. did they intentionally try to erase his personality? sounds like it was produced in nashville! this should be a demo for another singer to record. it's just too schmaltzy for me. i think phil ramone may be slipping too. billy is a much better singer than this. after listening to this song i instinctively lit a match. i'm going to go listen to glass houses ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative

 i recently saw them in san francisco just like one of the other reviewers and i thought it was astonishing. i know a lot of people got mad cause they didnt move around or anything i mean it couldn't be because they were trying to concentrate or anything like that! the great thing about this album is that all the instruments standout at the same time. farina(the lead singer)has calmed down after the last couple of albums and often times speaks his lyrics in a soft and heartfelt way that make you wish you could get into a conversation with him right then and there.and his guitar playing has even matures after the bed is in the ocean. the drummer just flat out rocks. his punctuality is a lot of the reason why these guys are so tight. the bass speaks just as well as the guitar does and sometimes takes over as the guitar holds it together and the bassist go off on his own little excursion. well if you have a problem with a band not rocking out i dont know what to tell you. it is jazzy but let me be the one to tell you this is the best jazz i've heard. i think this is the only path they could of taken. you got to evolve. sometimes that cant always be a good thing but in this case karate is the exception. love this ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive

 i bought this cd before going to see mmw (with john scofield) for the first time at first avenue in minneapolis dec 7 2006. i had never heard of them before and liked the clip on the venue's website. so i bought a ticket and wanted to get out louder which i knew they were going to play to familiarize myself but the store i was at was out of it. so i bought end of the world instead. while some of it was a little too spacey for my liking at first i still liked the overall funkiness of it all. then....i saw them play. you must see them play!! i didn't ever want it to end! i immediately wanted to see them again! it's less than a week later and i have 2 more cd's (out louder and scofield's a-go-go which they back him on) and 4 more on the way from amazon as i'm writing this. i'm like an addict now! i have to have them on in the car and in the house. i get back in the car after having been in a store or whatever and they're on and all is right with my world again. i must say i like out louder and even a-go-go better than end of the world but only slightly. it is trippy with the synth and the other guest players and i do like it better after a few listens. i just prefer mmw with less guest musicians ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative

 with the greatest respect to the incredible bob beldon joe zawinul and wayne shorter this box set should contain a warning. the warning is simple: if you already own most of the stuff in this collection don't bother. if you're completely new to weather report buy it. coming from someone that's seen the band perform every year since 1972 and own all their official and quite a few other releases i was really disappointed with this project (except for the booklet). here are a few things that are puzzling: 1) a weather report box set includes three songs (two composed by zawinul and one by shorter) that were never released by weather report: a. in a silent way. released by miles davis b. super nova released by wayne shorter c. experience in e (excerpt) released by cannonball adderly (i agree with the liner notes that point to these songs as pre-cursors but mentioning them would have been enough - they are all in print) 2) an incredible typo stating that alphonse mouzon was the drummer on unknown soldier 3) including a barely improved version of nubian sundance that has been in circulation for many years from other sources. 4) including another better than but not by much version of the other sources for the 1978 rockpalast concert on dvd. 5) not remastering any of the original recordings. the tape hiss from the live in tokyo (i sing the body electric) songs is still clearly heard and not upgrading those old recordings is just plain unacceptable in this day and age. 6) finally the cover itself - i have no words except to admit i don't get it. having said all that negative stuff - weather report remains the dominant creative machine of the jazz rock fusion era and those that missed it should buy this without hesitating. if you're a long time weather report fan - there's absolutely nothing to get excited about here. the dvd was especially disappointing to me. i have had that concert on vhs tape for many years and now on dvd (all from other sources) and was shocked to see such incredible video noise on the official version. zawinul's black and white keys look like polka-dots in many places. (i played the dvd in 5 different players; two tv's and my computer monitor to make sure it wasn't my equipment). i should have paid attention to the pr person at sony that told me the concert was taken from a re-broadcast of the show and not from the master tapes. it's my own fault for having unrealistic expectations. i should probably clarify that while the dvd is in fact clearly better than the un-offical version it still looks like a bootleg! sad... it is of some significance that this review is the first time i've chosen to speak out about something in fusion that was less than flattering. it should also be noted that my disappointment is aimed directly at cbs/sony/bmg and not the musicians/producers. i'm still amazed that this record company can see fit to release this and hold back the already remastered mahavishnu orchestra live in cleveland cd that was supposed to be released in 2004. lastly let me make it perfectly clear that zawinul shorter and beldon are musicians and people i personally hold in the highest esteem with zawinul and shorter being musical divinities as far as i'm concerned. while my review is an obvious personal venting and i realize that zawinul and shorter gave this project their stamp of approval i think that shouldn't be mistaken for a personal attack. my remarks are simply observations with some attitude directed at cbs/sony/bmg. by rick calic jazz rock world ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive
 i just refreshed my ears listening to riot again! getting to to hear 1/2 full which clocking in at just over 4 minutes is sheer electric blues magic. the price of this album is worth this one rocker alone. it was nice to see it on easy street (along with lukin' excellent!)any way this number totally kicks! definitely get this if you don't already own it. ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 the earlier reviews pretty much said it all; this is pretty much one of the best and most overlooked bands from the 90s. swervedriver is lumped into the shoegazer category often however if that label scares you off then dismiss its application to this band because they aren't so much shoegazer - in that cough-syrup-dreamy-noise way - as they are sonic rock. yes rock. who knew it could still be done and believe me they do it well and uniquely. if you've listened to swervedriver before then tehre isn't too much more to say - buy this album. it's not as hi-fi as 99th dream or mezcal head (in my opinion their best album and one of the best of 90s decade) but not as fast or dirty as raise. now if you have never listened to swervedriver this might not be the best album to start with - it all depends on your tastes. personally i would suggest starting with 99th dream or mezcal head; either way this has all the qualities of every swervedriver album - great lyrics superb and unique songs and that urge for more when it's over. sadly this band was vastly ill-treated by labels and they are no longer together (however some vestiges exist in the form of toshack highway). but if you want to see what you missed in the 90s - even more so if you want to see what the best of the best from that decade truly was - swervedriver is a must ,positive,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive
 for the past few years it has been very difficult to locate candid jazz cds the label that critic nat hentoff created over forty years ago. this was a real shame because some classic recordings including booker little's out front and max roach's we insist!: freedom now suite were on this label. i am happy to report that it was not because all of the albums were being deleted but because they were (slowly) being remastered. now some of the seminal early recordings of iconoclastic pianist cecil taylor are resurfacing like jumpin' punkins and now the world of cecil taylor. it is my opinion that taylor's currently unavailable (at least domestically) new york city r&b and world of c.t. are two of the great new jazz recordings of the early 60s. world recorded over two successive days in october 1960 is basically a trio date with buell neidlinger on bass and dennis charles on drums and archie shepp joining on tenor sax for two tracks air and the standard lazy afternoon. this disc is one of shepp's first recorded performances and the saxman apparently had trouble with taylor's music -- i recall the now out of print mosaic set of this material collecting some 15 plus outtakes of air. but the master takes are truly masterful and i am delighted that with this cd available once again we can all return to the world of cecil taylor. ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative

 like the other reviewer of this cd i am also a fan of buffalo tom. unfortunately this doesn't sound very similar to bt in fact it is a bit dull. none of the songs seem to have hooks or melodies that stick - after you hear it you instantly forget it. i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 to be fair since i only played it 3 times hoping it would grow on me. i'd recommend up here instead of this one it's much more listener friendly ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 i remember when this recording came out and wynton marsalis was being hailed as the second coming of jazz. i picked it up right away. i was mystified by the souless mimicry of art blakey's jazz messengers and miles' 2nd great quintet--this punk was supposed to be the savior of jazz? listen as wynton negotiates technically difficult arrangements stopping on a dime! marvel at his ability to explore the full range of dynamics within two bars!! gape in wonder at the fussy arrangement of think of one that strips the tune of any semblence of swing!!! i get it wynton--you've mastered the trumpet technically speaking which is no mean feat. and you can read music. bully for you. the only trouble is that you have nothing meaningful to say. ordinarily i'd feel sorry for you having wasted all those hours of practice except that you trashtalk musicians whose dirty drawers you aren't worthy of washing. people like john coltrane joe zawinul miles davis wayne shorter herbie hancock...i could go on and on but i think you get the point. this music is jazz by and for people who think that the best way to honor the past is to preserve it like a roach in amber thus killing it. ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 my copy of reckless nights... (and yours too probably) has a sticker on front that reads: one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. well i'm so glad that columbia cleared that up. otherwise i'd have had to make up my own mind and apparently music labels don't allow that nowadays. i hope similar stickers are included on chopin mozart and bach cds (with the century adjusted on a per-composer basis). scott's gimmicky fare makes for pleasant listening but not in such a large dose--monotony sets in after two or three titles let alone 22. halfway through this cd i felt as if i were listening to the drone of a defrosting icebox. for all the outrageous hyperbole thrown at scott--no one else like him no way to categorize his music and so on and so on--the reality is that composers and arrangers like ferde grofe duke ellington glenn miller alec templeton and bill challis covered the same ground far more skillfully--and in most instances earlier--than scott. concert jazz symphonic jazz or whatever you wish to call it was not the invention of any one man and certainly not scott. check out grofe's scores for whiteman--in particular his writing for woodwinds and his constant scott-esque use of muted trumpet. listen to duke ellington's extended compositions circa 1929. for that matter listen to ellington's 1933 daybreak express--virtually the template for scott's galloping miniatures. experience bill challis and glenn miller's pioneering big band charts. or... believe as you're told to believe i.e. that scott and scott alone performed this kind of music. i mean who needs history when we've got hype? it's up to you dear listener ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 i had tears in my eyes when i first heard this album. i get emotional over music i really like and this album got to me.so many great standards so well delivered by the duo. they deliberately chose slower ballads for this album so don't look for uptemposnappy songs in this one.not that harry warren could not write faster stuff like jeepers creepersshuffling off to buffalo etc. this album is to sing along with softly or hum.i kept thinking of bogart in the rain in casablanca and other lovers in w.wii.i know the main tune in that movie was not by harry warren;it simply reminded me of great love tunes from that era by julie styne[time after time] and the grossly underrated harry warren.grab someone you love some good wine and savor one of the great popular composers and a great duo.they should do more harry warren albumsmichael and george.i thank them profusely ,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative

 there have been innumerable motorhead collections over the years but this is one of the few that attempts to mix old with the new. on this collection all the classics are present and some newer material is thrown in as well. unfortunately there are some throw-away tracks mainly the girlscool and headgirl tracks. (to be honest these tracks are pretty much worthless.) some live tracks are meshed in and fit well and the newer songs help to add some variety to the old-scool stuff. i would recommend this collection to listeners looking to get a nice cheap collection of some of motorhead's best just for the sake of getting into the band. but if you're wanting the prime collection of older material save up some extra dough and buy no remorse or stone deaf forever. ,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative

 there's a reason oar flopped when it was released back in 1969: it sucks. thirty eight years later with skip spence safely in his grave some now give this pitiful mess *five* stars. since you can't give more than five stars here they're saying oar is on a level with masterpieces like sergeant pepper... dark side of the moon... led zeppelin 4....! just between you and me i think the government is still secretly drugging people. with all due respect to skip's venerable memory oar is a painful aural experience. the first two tracks little hands and cripple creek are halfway good and show some production values; but things quickly deteriorate from there. one gets the impression the rest of oar was cobbled together in the recording studio just prior to taping - then put in the can after only one or two takes. lastly the bass playing and drumming are just awful. yes it's too bad that things ended up like they did for skip. and it's hard not to sympathize with him - he flew high only to crash hard. but let's keep a sense of perspective: his tragedy did not translate into good music. one extra star in his memory. ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 i just finished seeing the movie and loved the song at the end and immediately started looking up amazon for this song. thanks to melania for pointing out the song title at the end. i realize this cd is just a soundtrack but typically most soundtracks also include the ending songs. it is just plain dumb not to include the best music in this cd. my vote - do not buy this cd. the soundtrack is all pretty generic stuff. but get the ending title song if you can - it's great. ,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative
 i've always held the philosophy you are what you're entertained by. so those who like ludacris are definitely telling on themselves about their views of life and women. and speaking of women...ludacris never met one who wasn't a h-o. ludacris is the epitome of the sexual hypocrisy that plagues men: you demean and look down on women for being h-oes yet you hope every woman is a h-o so you'll have no problems getting laid. but then you're so disgusted with the fact the woman behaves too much like you so you go and find a nice girl because you can respect her and marry her and procreate with her. but then you cheat on her with a bad girl because h-oes need h-oes; but then you can't respect the bad girl because she's a slut so you go back to the good girl. but she's not nasty enough for you so then...around and around we go. women are basically being punished for men not being able to make up their minds about what the heck they want from us. he's obsessed with sex and h-oes. it makes you wonder if he has hang-ups about it. maybe ludapis saw his mother selling herself in a backalley for a dollar and it scarred his outlook on women forever. i guess if she had actually raised him and shown him how to respect women-- all women--then he probably could have grown up to be a respectable guy instead of the prurient dummy he is. what's the music like? well i'll give him 2 stars for mentioning tlc in what's your fantasy. that's it. addendum: 7/27-07 some may wonder why i'm wasting' my time giving ludacris negative reviews. well first of all if only people who liked the product were the only ones to review it everything on amazon would have 5 stars which would be an inaccurate sign of its quality. secondly i don't like ludacris. i would give ludacris more respect if i felt he gave my gender more respect; but he doesn't. my diatribe above shows what my problem with him is and i feel that argument is valid. there's no way to critique ludacris' music without critiquing his hypocrisy regarding women. why should i like him when he seems to have nothing but contempt for us? i'm biased against him because he's biased against me. so he gets a bad rating out of s-p-i-t-e ,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative
 this record kind of sucks but that's okay because it doesn't suck in the way where you think &quot;oh hell we'll never get a good album out of this guy again&quot; (like for instance rod stewart's latest garbage) because i think it's not really lou's fault. the problem is lou's trying to draw his material from somewhere else in this case a mediocre poet. we've always been willing to overlook his (poe's) considerable lack of talent (example: &quot;in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore&quot;) because he's so damn charismatic. morbidly charismatic but charismatic nonetheless. the danger is that too many people consider his pure dumb fun to be art (which i guess makes him a lot like the rolling stones). lou who's always shown himself to be a poet but a poet with a wink has now chosen an artist who is basically bernie taupin with a better vocabulary to be his kindred spirit and from someone who velvet genius notwithstanding produced revolutionary and stunning works like transformer metal machine music and berlin this self-effacing friendship is the real tragedy ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 the restoration of a vivaldi opera must be a commendable effort specially if filling in big voids and rebuilding major missing parts of the masterpiece. motezuma is such an example where ample musical and artistic license was taken to bring it to life. like restoring a canvas where not only the colors and forms had faded but also sizeable parts were ripped off and lost reconstructing motezuma presents the challenge for the restorer of thinking and dreaming and becoming as inspired as vivaldi. in listening to motezuma one can pick up the original vivaldian compositions from the reconstructed material as clear as looking at a combination painting part picasso part michelangelo. as much as such painting can be taxing to the eye portions of this opera can be as disappointing to the ear. except for several arias and the two sinfonias the music has a touch and taste of the 1800's but not of the baroque settecento. the juxtaposition of the restorative style is also distractive and just does not work. it makes at times the orchestration devoid of the vivaldi unf charm and texture. nonetheless motezuma's musical beauty can be found in great arias such as d'ira e furor armato la figlia lo sposo gl'otraggi della sorte d'ove la figlia? s'impugni la spada and performances by vito priante inga kalna and marijana mijanovic. bravo for vito priante and his interpretation of gi'otraggi della sorte and d'ove la figlia. he does a great ornamentation in the da capos and turns up the volume in all the right notes. just like terribile lo sento and orribile lo scempio gi'otraggi shares the same musicalization. somehow this version of the score is especially more dramatic and subtlely more melodic. ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative
 what i love most about scofield's recent guitar playing is the subtlety in his style. he is careful not to over do it while still demonstrating skill and precision. his riffs are practically perfect and are very well placed. the only problem with this is that with no vocals and many similar sounding songs i rarely make it to the end of this cd. still for those who enjoyed &quot;a go-go&quot; this one is quite similar so make sure to pick it up. this quality funk cd with jazz undertones may not being groundbraking but is a great casual listen.

 i forgot how bad this album was until i popped it into my cd player the other day. it seems like every song has one or two parts that are totally killer followed by 3-4 minutes of boredom. the song epic problem is good throughout and full disclosure is excellent except for the horrible screamed verses. strangelight is awesome too and not very typical of fugazi. the kill is also good in the same way it's very chilled out. past these few standout tracks(which wouldn't be standouts at all on any other album of theirs) there isn't much reason to listen to the album. it's incredibly boring. i suggest picking up any other fugazi album first maybe 13 songs red medicine or in on the kill taker ,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative
 i purchased empty not long after it came out and it was fairly enjoyable but eventually forgettable pop/rock. this sophomore effort is simply put amatuer and sub-par. some of these sound like they would have been packaged more effectively as empty b-sides while the cover of electric avenue never really distracts most listeners from thinking what is this and why? over all this might appeal to most christian radio listeners but only because they will never scrutinize it for what it actually is: mold-fitting white noise ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive

 neither the amazon review or any of the customer reviews recently submitted mention this fact. i have few classical and pop recordings in mono that do not impact the listening experience such as 'songs for swinging lovers' - frank sinatra or beethoven's opera fidelio - conductor otto klemperer (testament label). the material on these recordings are so good that the listener completely ignores the fact that they are mono recordings. i did not hear anything outstanding on this cd to make me overlook the 'mono' factor. is this some great jazz masterpiece recorded live in carnegie hall by two giants of jazz? i personally don't think so. somehow this material remained in obscurity for all this time and somebody by accident discovered this gem - if you believe that then elvis is alive and the earth is exactly 6000 years old. with small jazz bands i like to listen to the musicians communicate with each other within the context of a thesis. examples: 'sunday at the village vanguard - bill evans trio' or 'new york reunion - mccoy tyner quartet'. i wanted to but could not hear anything of this sort in this recording. this material is more likely to be understood only by the performers themselves and the real jazz aficionados. it may have been hasty but after one listen i decided to sell this cd and i have no regrets other than buying it in the first place. ,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative
 as owner of every single chill/lounge music cd i am aware of this was the biggest dissapointment in a long time. ultra chill series 1-4 was outstanding. while ultra chill 05 is not a complete disaster i could not find one song worthy of a 5/5 star rating. quite a few 4 star songs and lots of 2-3 star songs. some of the better songs were repeated on older chill discs or present on other series of lounge discs. there is a lot of jazz and latin chill on these two discs which i also like but the jazz/world/latin chill tracks here were repeats or nothing great. i think the person that rated this 5 stars doesn't own a lot of lounge/chill and is probably a lot easier to please. i'm very dissapointed. maybe this 'genre' is all dried up! :) oh well... i'm off to listen to chillout seesions 8... hopefully it will be a lot better. i highly reccomend chillout seesions by ministry of sound. chillout sessions 1-7 are outstanding... time to go listen to the new 8! ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative
 presumably the label is trying to cater to mid-range fans who have a prince album or two but don't want to buy them all and who want more than a single disc hits collection. the way this is laid out though is confusing at best: disc 1 seems to be for the mid-range fan and it makes sense that they would choose the single edits though some of those chosen are questionable. (my name is prince? his take on nothing compares 2 u when sinead o'connor's is definitive?) disc 2 compiles 12 mixes and remixes and similar rarities..i.e. for the diehard only who has to have every little bleat his purpleness every records. bottom line: this is haphazardly thrown together. middle range fans are better off with the hits/the b-sides which compiles his biggest chart stuff with a pretty decent selection of interesting flip side material (some of which equals his singles) ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative

 man have i given this guy a chance. multiple chances. listened to the cds saw the big hbo special. i mean his career is red hot now. he clearly has lots of fans. mostly college age (perhaps this should be a warning to some of you). all i can say is maybe they'll grow out of it. he is not funny. his act has no bite no point of view no opinion/viewpoint at all. his comedy consists of spewing observations his audience can relate to (the this is all happened to us or has this ever happened to you? school of humor). he runs about manically acting out every little word that comes out of his mouth (for those in the audience that may not be so good with words). his fans acknowledge that yes they can relate. yeah! that's happened to me! i know that reference!' they laugh cheer clap and plunk down their hard-earned dollars for his vanilla wit. he never actually comments on the things he discusses in any intelligent interesting way. he has no edge. he's not outraged by anything. he's cute 'n' cuddly. richard pryor must be rolling in his grave at the very fact that cook is classified as a stand up comic. pryor? the guy writing this must be old!' okay try this on for size: chris rock is good comedy. same with dave chappelle. carlin. laura kightlinger. kinison. rodney dangerfield. bob saget. gilbert gottfried. dom irrera. lewis black. robert klein. the late mitch hedberg. jim norton. patton oswalt. brian posehn. degeneres. jon stewart. bob & david. the ucb. i'm not even a big fan of sarah silverman but at least she's trying to bring something different to the party. anything but this! god help us. let's hope he goes the way of carrot top and dice soon (don't forget cook fans mr. top and mr. clay were once as popular as your boy here) ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive
 i bought this disc hoping for pristine remastered sound and what i got was shrill noise with all the hiss sucked out. the guy who typed a review in all caps is a moron! it's better than an mfsl disc because the artist approved it? yeah right! get real! i might need a new hi-fi if i don't like the sound? please! you idiots know nothing about what good sound quality is and either does peter mew or rob caiger. thanks for nothing! sony should be sued by people who bought this horrible disc for deceptive practices...saying that the full-length version of roll over beethoven was used! what a crock! and so what if they used the original master tapes? using a master tape doesn't mean anything if you're going to smother it in noise processing and master it poorly! don't buy this disc! hang onto the old us versions or even better the japanese issue. don't give sony your money for this shambles of a product ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 the kidz bop series is the ultimate travesty in music. and don't think that it's good just because your kids might love it. kids also like to eat mcdonalds but don't try telling me that their food is healthy. there is plenty of good music out there than is clean enough for children. and surprisingly a lot of these songs are very inappropriate for children even with the expletives deleted. there is no reason on earth why these records should exist excepting for the fact that record execs want to milk more money out of the singles once their radio play starts to diminish. i agree with the person who suggested the beatles as an alternative. seriously don't buy this! ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative

 people this is easy listening at it's easiest. every song is and will be a candidate for adult contemperary rotation in 2 years that is if it isn't allready. i don't know anything about what they have done in the past except for a song i remember being played on the radio a few years ago. must have been on the album prior to this. but that song sounds just like two tracks on this one. not only that but if there wasn't a pause in between these mini mediocre fests i couldn't really tell any of them apart. horrible music with no feeling or soul not even creative. don't waste your time with this. ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative

 ok good cd. im not suprised. ok jaheim may not have the b best voice but his music is good and it goes will with the voice that he has. yes yall this album does use profanity but the songs actually have meanings. i like that daddy thing song and like a dj. this album looks at issues from a mans point of view. ya know we've heard the angry woman and how the man did t his and that now jaheim looks at it from a males view. ok yall i know he is not the first one to do this but he did it well. also this is a break from that [...] that is played on the radio. ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative
 yet even some of you who agree that the album bites still say that tub thumping is okay even if it gets old after awhile. that song is crap!!! has to be one of the worst songs ever to get play. ever! sounds like a bad radio commercial for some english beer they're trying to market in the states. that song (if you can call a random string of cheesy choruses a song) makes the strongest argument against anarchy that i've ever heard. proves that people who can't agree on anything can't make a song that makes any sense or follows any consistent theme. gotta go - just threw up in my mouth from the bilious memory of this worthless pop drivel ,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative
 percy grainger was a man of spectacular gifts. he was one of the most original composer/arrangers in the early part of this century. he was also a spectacular pianist in an age of spectacular pianists. this amazing cd documents grainger's formidible gifts. it cannot be over-praised. both the music and the performances are well worthy of any piano lover's attention. don't miss this one ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative

 you know after really trying to like this album i must agree with k johnson. oftentimes a really good album sounds horrible (or just plain plain) upon one or three spins so when this album didn't move me the first time i decided to hang back and try again in a few days. then again. and again. and one more time. usually after three or four complete spins (which was like work with this one)the jems will work there way to the surface. sufjian stevens was like that. so was z by my morning jacket. but the problem was that i really wanted to like this one. all the reviews i read were hyping this as the album of the decade and i wanted them to be right. unfortunately none of them were right. it is a plodding lifeless album wanting desperately to be 'hip' and failing miserably to the point of being embarassing almost. like your 40 something hipster college prof with a graying ponytail (who will love this by the way) it will be pointless to argue with those who like this album. i have to say that it is obvious these guys put a lot of work into this and they do have talent; it just doesn't get me there. i hope they can live up to the hype next time. i truly do.. ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 my two parakeets seem to enjoy this cd a bit but if you want a cd for relaxing listening be prepared to be irritated. i tried to go to sleep listening to it one night. i had to turn it off because it just got on my nerves.....i kept thinking it was stuck....like a record stuck in a grrove. it sometimes seems they recorded it by just hitting the &quot;repeat&quot; button on a couple of bird sounds. i think i could have done that. i'm just glad it didn't cost a lot but now i can see why. sorry for such a bad review but i just had to tell anyone planning on buying it. i now just play it for my birds when i am not in the room ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 gene watson was one of the finest voices in country music and this compilation of 18 hits provide a fine sampling of that voice. considered by some to be hard country i find gene watson to have a more pop oriented voice that combined well with his selection of songs; and in the '70's that proved to be enough to keep him on the charts. while many of the songs on this album are pure country others are the typical drab 70's pop that filled the void between the nashville sound and the new traditional era of the 80's. in any case there is no doubt that gene watson earned his spot in country music and this collection carries those hits that made him the household name he is today; including his signature songs farewell party and love in the hot afternoon. if you prefer the more traditional country sound his you could know as much about a stranger and should i come home are also included ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative
 no use thumbing the pages of cale's elegant scrapbook of an autobiography 'what's welsh for zen? to glean hard data on this one melodic gem. coming after the heady if problematic days of the velvets there's barely an acknowledgement of it as he strides into his rock format. the abrasive thrashing rock of 'mcbeth'(while indicating his imminent direction) serves the one discordant note. throughoutcale namedrops to effect learnedness without destroying the mood of a distant past. language had been severed from lineal meaning in rock since bob went electric. pete brown writing for jack bruce's towering masterpieces 'songs for a sailor' & 'harmony row'; keith reid with procul harum were mixing up the lyric medicine presumably with other pharmacuticals & making sumptuous music on a par with 'paris 1919'. that date? the birth of surrealism(and similar writing to cale's efforts herein) perhaps? the russian revolution? cale's singing on 1919 had a world weary distance to it which suited the reflective jabberwocky of the songs; stretched out vowells on'planing lakes' 'elephants that sing''looking out from here at half past france.' it was far from banal music however saccharine the orchestral moves from strings viola & piano cale painted. these lyrics were baffling but made perfect poetic sense when sung. 'locusts' was something of a revisiting to this pastoral mood but lacks the roundedness. 'fragments of a rainy season' is a good retrospective concert. and some of the fuge written around the hommage to andy warhol is very moving stuff. go john ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

 the music on this album is performed so exquisitely; the orchestrations so subtle and yet illuminating that one is almost tempted to forget what a what for? musical this is. donna murphy plays the title character of fosca a hugely unprepossessing woman who suffers from more maladies than there are stars in the sky. she lives in a remote miltary outpost where she falls in love with the handsome virile giorgio. giorgio in turn is having a torrid affair with the beautiful but vapid clara a married woman back home. however from the time giorgio comes into fosca's sphere she becomes this relentless succubus in her pursuit of him. she shows up everywhere he happens to be; her ferocity matched only by her inexhaustive capacity for self-pity. to depict fosca musically sondheim comes up with the most monochromatic score of his career. everything is so lugubrious dark portentous tragic; punctuated by militaristic strains (with snare drums)because the soldiers like to...umm...march. in the end giorgio is worn down enough by fosca's attentions that he succumbs. he believes he has fallen in love with her shortly after which she...dies. as i mentioned earlier the material is beautifully performed (marin mazzie and jere shea render the opening happiness with a marvelous sense of delicacy and sensuality. donna murphy evokes the proper pathos in the haunting loving you.) but you come away wondering what the point of it all is. if sondheim is trying to show us how love is largely a chronic disease then he succeeds admirably ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative
 the edward scissorhands score will always be one of my absolute favorite movie scores. i truly believe this is danny elfman's best score and believe me he's done some great scores! the music is so moving. the childrens chorus mixed with the soft bells and strings were absolutely perfect for this sweet beautiful film. even people who haven't seen this film have probably heard the music from it since it is used in so many film previews and commercials. a must-have for any danny elfman and/or tim burton fan ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 ...but this album should never have been released as the final queen-album. a couple of these songs should instead have been added as bonus tracks to one of those many best of queen-releases. a winters' tale for example. do i know much about the background for made in heaven well perhaps not. but i know that this is known to be the last studio release. sadly it has the sound of elevator-music all over not that the melodies are bad it just sounds... almost cheap actually -and most importantly to my ears (at least) this doesn't sound like my queen. one of the most important bands in the history of music saying good-bye with made in heaven? was this really freddie mercurys' wish? it doesn't make much sence after the fantastic innuendo released in short time before his tragic death containing the haunting ballad these are the days of our lives. the words and the music... wow! and the music video to this song have you seen it? to me that was the real good-bye with freddie and with queen. and it has the sound of how i will remember them. but is made in heaven really that bad? yes and no. heaven for everyone by roger taylor made it sound promising and don't forget; i was exited when i heard about a final material-release. but it turned out as you might have guessed far from what i had expected. old songs from b-sides and solo-albums are mainly fillers for this album... i mean honestly? too much love... then quite a resent hit from brian mays' solo-album back to the light i remember thinking what's the point? and it actually sounds better from his solo-album without the synth dominating the song here. don't get me wrong now freddies' vocal is as good as you'd expect it's what they've made out it that surprises me. and what makes me wish they hadn't. at least not for an entire album. a winters' tale is a positive surprise though. perhaps not freddies' best song and not better than these are the days.... but it's a celebration of the beauty in life. at least it sounds like that to me. freddie captures a moment of harmony and peace. and beauty. and it sounds like a classic queen-song! a beautiful day (intro and reprise) functions well too. but what tracks 12 and 13 are about i have absolutely no idea..? i wish they would have ended the album with freddies' last yeah! on the song. i wish... so all in all; innuendo remains the explosive good-bye with the real queen. at least it does to me. (let me add that the cover of made in heaven is perfect for the title and somehow amazingly seals in its' simplicity the fate of the band with freddie in the lead. the three band members left (brian roger john) facing the sunset and a statue capturing freddie in a remembarable style on stage. reminding me of him at wembley 86. to me this actually expresses something beyond words and it's impossible not to get a bit of an empty feeling watching it while listening to heaven for everyone or a winters' tale.) ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative

 many albums including this one have the problem that all the songs pretty much sound the same; but this also has the troublesome problem of music that is too easy on the ears and that never gets very exciting - except for the first two tracks. the use of many poetry elements in their lyrics can't save the blandness of the music. what about everything and life less ordinary are good songs. the rest pretty much sound the same and will put you to sleep. ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 after two albums of wholly instrumental music joe satriani apparently decided it was time to start singing. flying in a blue dream is the only satriani record with several (six) vocal cuts. so how are they? well satch's voice isn't superb but he does an ok job. the problem really is with the material-- it's clear he'd gotten used to writing pieces as guitar features. the only real exception to this in my assessment is frantic electric blues big bad moon-- the piece is blazing and explosive the vocal is passable and satriani is on fire. but pieces like ride the phone call and strange are all pretty much forgettable (well ride is actually a bit too irritating to be forgettable...). the remainder of the material is a mix between exploratory (and primarily acoustic) pieces (the feeling) which are nice but largley filler and surfing with the alien styled instrumentals (one big rush back to shalla-bal). the exception is the chugging opener and title track flying in a blue dream which features satriani at his most lyrical as a guitarist. invariably the album is a bit too weak for its own good-- it's probably also a bit too long (about 65 minutes) and probably would have benefited from being trimmed down a bit. start with surfing with the alien come back to this if you want more of the same ,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative
 mississippi and sugar baby are great songs up there with the best dylan has done. however the rest of the album while listenable isn't all that memorable. still i suppose it's amazing that he can still produce a couple of great songs still after over 40 years performing and recording. the same cannot be said for '60s peers like paul mccartney or the stones. overall time out of mind was better although that too was a little overrated with only not dark yet standing in the doorway and trying to get to heaven truly belonging to the canon of great bob songs. ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 no one questions lyrics born's talent which can be matched by few. his breakneck delivery will make you swear they sped him up in the studio except then if you go see him do it live (recommended: he is a charismatic performer) you realize they didn't. the problem with this release is not therefore lyrics born himself. it's just that there's not enough interesting things happening around him. there are handful of standout songs on this record but there is no excuse for it running as many tracks as it does. the skits remind me why i sometimes think the whole idea of skits on cds tired itself out in about 1997 if not earlier. worse the fillers sound similar to the hits but less memorable making the whole album kind of drag and the grooves guitar licks and keys all of which are good in small doses become sort of flat after a time especially when joyo velarde isn't singing backup vox. surely a few of the songs could have become b-sides on the single or something instead of bloating the album itself. do that there rise and shine and one session are my favorite tracks the ones i would say go buy from the itunes store or something right now. there's nothing wrong with the rest i just don't find myself listening to them much. i like the concept of later that day but it should probably take less time out of the day to listen to ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 undoubtedly marnie belongs to the top list of bernard herrmann's best film scores a wonderful musical image of alfred hitchcock's underrated movie. written for small ensemble (strings woods harp and horns) herrmann gives the music a wonderfully flowing mood tasteful and delighted along with the dark characteristics in every second bar that herrmann so masterful handles in all his works for hitch. joel mcneely's reading is simply stunning as ever so is the performance but i just don't like the overall acoustics on these varse rerecordings with the large hall reverb giving the orchestra no room for details. they simply are overheard in this muffled sound. this is far from ideal for recording a film score and i bet herrmann would not have liked this! but it's a great great score ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative

 the 4 cd mini gibson amp 'box-set'leaves off genuine off vinyl 78 and lp 'harder-to-get' charlie christian/benny goodman recordings. legacy states master takes but absolutely fails to research deep into charlie christian's recording history. columbia vinyl 2lp 30779 (1972) and columbia 78rpm c -102 along with the columbia sextet cds leave legacy far behind. the wang wang blues -78rpm isn't in the 4cd set and there are far too many 'false-starts' which benny goodman discarded for a good reason. star dust is only about 3 minutes it's 8 minutes on vinyl. there is even in-studio handclapping after some tunes. i have the 78s many col. lps and there is no studio-live takes. this 4 cd box could have and should have been much better in information content and genuine charlie christian guitar stylings. the 2 readily available bg sextet cds are a better purchase idea but there are still those super hard-to-get vinyl lp tracks which are the master takes left off the legacy/sony box set. musicologist's suggestion try to get the vinyl lps. skip this misleading 4 cd set of various tracks + handclapping = not good enough to keep (airmail special). try the 2 benny goodman/charlie christian columbia cds amazon has both and most of the benny goodman sextet 'takes' are master takes and good enough to keep! ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative
 i'm not sure about all that other nonsense the reviewer before me is talking about (sounds like someone with an axe to grind)but this album is a stunning piece of workmanship. the music is inspired the melodies transcending and the emotion - deep and meaningful. as far as copying yanni goes well - i don't agree in fact yanni is far more generic and less inspired. the sound samples the cranky reviewer alludes to are in fact not the same nor are they yanni's creation. i write this review to commend mr farish on his work and to take to task the idiot who misinformed others and couldn't resist his own urge to see his critique in print. ryans music is distinctly his own no question - and any similarities are tonal and not compositional - which the reveiwer would be well advised to take note of. as far as i'm concerned you be the judge - and let cranky wannabe music critics continue to wallow in their own self hate as they surf store shelve's and websites for music to criticize - and well make themselves feel a little better. personally i would recommend this album to anyone who likes strong songs with great production and uplifting energy. all the other stuff is for hacks! enjoy this music! i do. ,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative
 despite the excellent screenplay by sam shepherd and the solid acting by harry dean stanton i found paris texas a rather unimpressive film and the only thing that kept it together for me was cooder's astounding soundtrack. the music here is simple yet very moving and even haunting. his guitar stylings really captured the mood and feel that the film was otherwise supposed to convey. it seems to seep right out of the desolate landscape of the southwest. every time i listen to this cd it reminds me of driving along some deserted highway in nevada se california etc. also it's really nice that the soundtrack contains the story (i knew these people) told by stanton's character since to me that was the best part of the movie. even so seeing paris texas is not a prerequisite for enjoying this cd the music is phenomenal in its own right ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative

 while photek was (and still is) reknowned for his minimalist approach to breakbeats and electronic sound his approach changes significantly on &quot;solaris.&quot; starting off with the first three tracks his beats still retain some of the stattacco nature of his earlier work (especially on &quot;modus operandi&quot;) but sound more full more resonant. the tracks where he wanders into the realm of house were quite repeditive and despite robert owen's wonderful efforts (first time i've heard him) they were lacking. the best track on the album and one of the best photek works is definitely &quot;infinity.&quot; the rumbling bass really cuts right to the core and reminds me a little of source direct. the trip-hop efforts are good for his first attempt at such music but the more ethereal &quot;halogen&quot; left an impression. a wash of sound that previously parkes would be itching to rip apart with a snare roll it comes off much better for the lack of any true form. not a great album but solid and indicative of where photek would like to go in terms of his future works ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative

 i'd like to second some of the other reviewers' reviews of this album. it really lacks the energy and the coherence of the previous album. the tracks in general are a little slower. the production quality is overall about the same but it is just not as listenable as believe was. the exception i find on the album is the club mix of turn it around. but if we think about that for a second aren't we talking about club music here afterall? are we under any pretenses that this is elevator or lobby music? i should think not. what we expect from this band and from a second album is an equal or better effort at club music. house-ish trance-ish and anthemic. it's just missing on turn it around. i wholeheartedly recommend believe but i'd steer clear of this one unless you find it used. ,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative
 the remix is totally devoid of any taste:first the vocals are completely-off;the mix levels of vocals is far lower than the new musical dressings. secondlythere is absolutely no respect on part of the mixing djs for the great vocalists:there is no melody and absolutely no 'jelling-together' of the music with the vocals. i was deeply disappointed with this cd.if you are into remixes get the rod stewart do ya think i am sexy single cd instead ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative
 relationships and drug use are major themes. this album starts off with two absolute killer tunes lets down some but has a joy thoughout. i can't believe this is going to be his only album.....what a shame. from someone who has been listening to rock for a long time i tell ya this is a blast. pure fun. something you might want to give to someone you have broken up with as its full of a broken heart and the joy of being in love.....mostly rather quickly paced. one of my favorite albums of the 90s. more people should listen ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive
 this album is so boring in most places. i don't know where keith sweat's head was at. it doesn't keep your attention on the second half. keep it comin' was okay but the other songs keith produced as well as joe public were lousy. he was smart to include there you go from new jack city but the songs before and after it are so bland it seemed like the formula that worked for keith sweat's first two albums didn't work here. i fell to sleep while hearing the album's second half--how can anyone create such dull songs on here? sweat's trademark whining just does not blend with these songs. if he had wanted to he would have given these songs to usher instead of singing them himself--they'd be better under him(usher). but i warn you don't get this album--it's going to let you down ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 good stuff! an excellent collection of original and classic gypsy jazz tunes artfully performed by jorgenson. i recommend it as an introduction to the virtuosity of john jorgenson and the genius of django reinhardt ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative
 i'm only giving this 5 stars because the actual recordings are priceless. however i'm telling you now. do not buy this album this is stolen goods and the recordings that are on this cd are not even of the finest quality. this is purely a commercial album released by the record company without the permission of jack off jill's members. and thus they recieve no royalties for the selling of this album. fear not though. you can get the tracks off this album completely free and in better quality. agent moulder of jack off jill has remastered and released them on her website for your downloading pleasure. you can find them here: t-c-r.net/jojmusic while you are there check out and support her new band tcr and their new album 'the chrome recordings'. singer jessicka also has an amazing new band if you didn't already know. check her and scarling. out at scarling.com god bless jack off jill. ,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative
 while well produced i was disappointed in the album - mostly because the majority of the tracks were re-recordings. frankie laine still sounds great - but it just wasn't the same. i bought the cd to replace a well worn vinyl album but on listening to the cd i found the songs to all be slightly (and in a couple of cases very) different in tempo and vocal inflection - it's definitely not the album i've loved for over 30 years! high noon in particular is quite different much slower with vocal emphasis changed. i'll probably listen to the cd from time to time but not with the same relish that i enjoyed my old lp ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative
 tame's music is all about the beat. it's what got me right from the start a grinding repetitious backbone to every song. tame one rides every beat on these tracks without faltering and shows some true style in his delivery. tame gets rid of the verse-hook standarda periodically ad-libing and allows the music to play when he feels like pausing. its an amazing album well worth purchasing. ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 i read about lila downs' new cd la cantina in victor cruz- lugo's article entitled sweet sorrow published in the june-july 2006 issue of hispanic magazine (page 76). it is an honor and a pleasure to offer these few reflections on lila downs' new cd la cantina: 1. the cd cover is awesome a beautiful and colorful work of art illustrating lila in a pensive and contemplative mid-air pause with her guitarra ready to rock. it strikes me as an example of the rising feminine in our time awakening the historically-oppressed feminine from its slumber and into an alto canto of unstoppable and celebratory song. 2. each track is a lively composition of mexican corridos and sones impregnated with lila's lovely voice that makes me feel so proud to be mexicano-chicano-hualahuisense and a member of our precious universal human family. 3. i first was introduced to lila downs and her musical talent when i enrolled in writer juan felipe herrera's legendary manikrudo summer arts class at cal state fresno in 2000. juan felipe invited her to our class room and she impressed us all with her down-to-earth talented voice. later that night we all saw her in concert at the tower theatre in fresno and i've been a fan of her work ever since. 4. this new cd is indeed a delightful experience. i appreciate that she moved into the corrido son etc. genres which makes me appreciate her music so much more. it has so much more appeal to me without bordering on the commercial and superficious. it's authentic and retains its articistic musical integrity. i think that this is a hallmark that we can expect from all of lila's work. she is a true artist. i've always appreciated her darker and earthier songs in her first two cds however this new stride into popular folk corridos is a movement into another aspect of the heart and soul of the mexicano experience. 5. i am very impressed with lila's voice and how it has matured since the summer of 2000. there seems to be more color and flair in it and definitely mucho corazon. ahua! her solos in yo ya me voy have my soul spinning to the outer edges of infinity. as victor cruz-lugo writes through it all downs' powerful alto voice cuts a path into the deepest pits of your heart tears something out of there and somewhow we as listeners wind up asking her for more of the same. this is my favorite of lila's repertoire. it is my opinion that those who purchase this cd will not be disappointed. enjoy! ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive

 i admit when i listened to this album i was blown away by the powerful content of kenny g's music. i was moved by the story line and also by the music that was used during the movie. kenny g's music is perfect for this kind of movie. not only that it adds flavor to the movie by his sensual playing of saxophone but also adds mood to the entire show. this is the perfect soundtract for the movie dying young because it just simply shows the real mood in the movie ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative
 i got secret story as a christmas present last year. i had asked for imaginary day because the only tune i had heard from pat metheny was the roots of coincidence and i was itching for more. i still couldn't wait to hear what was on secret story but i was hoping it would be in the same vain as the roots of coincidence. what i ended up hearing was an incredible cd with a vast scope filled with emotions that change from tune to tune. searching for tunes to sound like roots was not successful; instead i joyfully found a complete and very unique set. i agree with others that for maximum experience you should have enough time to listen to it in one sitting straight through. the musical roller coaster is the most extravagant when done this way. i found myself trying to pick out favorite tunes but i ended up picking ones for only a particular mood (such as an upbeat or sedative one). i could just as easily pick a few different tunes for another mood. that's why it's fun to listen to it straight through: no other album of mine gives me so much in so little time. of course metheny has apparently mastered the flow of the tracks too: one leads right into the next creating oh maybe a story? i don't know the story but it's a lot of fun to make up a different story each time you listen to it. i guess the tune that i most like to play no matter what mood i'm in is cathedral in a suitcase with it's mesmerizing 3-against-2 beat and a well-crafted three-chord progression that it revolves around. tunes range from the euphoric (cathedral finding and believing facing west the truth will always be) to the sweet (the longest summer sunlight always and forever) to the smooth (rain river antonia as a flower blossoms see the world) to the calm and reflective (above the treetops tell her you saw me not to be forgotten). of course this is all the tunes and it makes for such a satisfying experience. since this is my first metheny cd i am definitely going to pursue more. metheny seems worth my time and money ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 even as a joke this would be horrible; however i think this band take it seriously - and it blows! i picked up this cd because i heard a.r.e. were like a combination of suicide front 242 and iron maiden: interesting. no!! a.r.e. are a bad imitation of front 242 and watered-down liars at best. the guitar riffs are awful and the lyrics are even worse. example: hey world begins with how much it sucks to be 13. when i saw pelican in concert they were opening (?!?!?) for a.r.e. so i decided to give them a second chance. the sound guy must not have liked what he heard because the bar chatter was louder. louder i yelled so that i might find something redeeming in their music. yeah suck louder! someone else yelled - i had to agree & give him a high-five. maybe i would have liked this when i was 12 and didn't know any better. zero stars ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 i bought this because i thought this cd would be nice to listen to in the car while on out and about. i love that our 2 1/2 year old daughter who is from china loves this cd and will request it chinese flute please. this is just one way to keep her heritage alive and expose her to different kinds of music beyond the wiggles & lilo & stitch cd. i would have liked to have had more information on the songs like what province of china. but not having this information really does not lessen the rating of 5 stars! our family thinks this is an excellent cd ,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 this album is lame as hell but next to the air pollution on the airwaves today this aint too bad thats why it gets a 2. right before female rappers(there's a few exceptions) i hate all little kid rappers. even when i was a kid. i don't like anything on this album i still got the tape and it hasn't krossed my mind to even cop the cd. if you like this kind of stuff or you loved jump back in the day then i guess this is for you ,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative

 i used to like rob zombie up until hellbilly delux. everything after that is garbage. this album is no exception. every song sounds the same and is very predictable. the lyrics are nonsensical educated horses? he says that phrase in like 3 or 4 songs on this cd i think he is running out of material and throwing crappy cd's together to scrap in some extra money. he needs to quit before everyone forgets he used to be talented. i don't recommend this cd to anyone except the die-hard stalker-type fans that will buy all of his cd's/merchandise regardless. 1 star i went through this cd in less than 10 minutes very disappointed and will never put it back into a cd-player again ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 some of the songs here are good most notably never be forgotten.....beautiful. i heard this song on the radio and i thought it was faith hill or martina mcbride singing. herein lies the problem. the song is good the voice is good. but if she sounds like faith or martina there's no distinction to set her off from the rest of the pack out there. add to this that this is mostly bubble-gum pop and not country....there's really nothing that stands out here. why are recording companies giving contracts to people who sound like everybody else out there? that's the question. ,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative
 what can i say that most of the people reviewing this cd haven't already said. arthur is outrageously talented. it's almost shocking. the depth of songwriting and production values are so intense. it's extremely well recorded and mixed music. anyone into audio manipulation should just buy all of his albums right now. stumble and pain is probably my favourite track. the sinister tone of it and the synth effects are just superb. as with all arthur albums the vocals are dense layered and its something he's obviously worked on for a long time and it really pays off on this album! anyone new to him should buy this immediatly and buy redemption's son straight after that. what a musician ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative

 when i first purchase this album the first time. it was exceptional then and it still is . exceptional and gifted group these ladies rule the early 90's. some of my favorites free your mind my lovin it ain't over till the fat lady sings just to name a few. envogues voices all of them work masterfully together they way a head of their time. as far as female groups they rank 5 stars in my book following such groups as supremes labelle tlc the had allot orginiality and appeal that drew people to them because of the voices and their orignal material. they are trendsetters. please go buy this cd. i will buy it again myself. i have the cassette. i need the cd for my collection. i know they came out with a new album hopefully this will be a great album as well. go envogue g ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative
 this is a pep rally on cd; an unsingable emotionally charged pep rally. it really upsets me that this is the face of today's christian music. the melodies are not easily singable at all and the songs use all the same musical cliches. this is worship manipulation at it's best. if you read the words to learn something concrete about god you will find nothing of substance. they talk about actions to give god and our response to god but no meat-and-potatoes of why we should be doing this. god is great but why? this is very disturbing and completely unacceptable for congregational worship. ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative

 there is not enough space for me to explain why this film(and soundtrack) are woefully inadequate of the name dr. seuss. the fact that there are so many songs on the album screams commercialism(what the book was complaining about wake up people!) and james horner's score which has a couple of nice moments but doesn't have that seussian sound. 'where are you christmas' is annoying beyond all reason and i mean both versions. and whose bright idea was it to have jim carrey mangle 'you're a mean one'? if you're looking for a more grinch like score go find elfman's nightmare before christmas ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 this album is essentially a fusion of great musical minds. the legendary khan payes more attention to making this a better experience for the western audiences of the sufi music by playing more with his (brilliant) vocal skills then with the lyrics. micheal brooks' music stands out and enhances the experience further. this is not to say that the mainstream indo-paki audience won't enjoy this album ( this is one of my all time favs). it is fabulous background listening while doing work which may need focus - for those who need music to do such things... :) for those who have been thinking of testing out sufi music this is the place to start. this is a fine introduction to the great nfak and sufi music. ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 this cd is without a doubt amazing. stars are lost because prior to recording you would think the guitarist would invest in a damn noise gate for his guitar rig. his tone is crushing & sounds perfect but the second he stops playing every time ssssqqqqqquuuueeeaaaalllll. it's annoying to the point of only being able to tolerate so many songs at once because it is a chronic problem in every song. ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 what's more to say about what may be the best rock album ever (especially if you consider the my kingdom ep to be the second disc in a two disc set)? the most emotionally wide-ranging album from one of the best bands ever. who else has ever made music like fsol? the beatles and fripp&crimson are the only possible contenders. i've never heard anything that does a better job of juxtaposing the terrifying and the unbearably beautiful. if i could pinpoint the one disinguishing feature of all fsol/aa releases it would be (as a line in the isness goes) ...[a longing for] inexhaustible ecstasy. it's all the more poignant on this album because of its being interwoven with themes of terror paranoia and a sense of unrecoverable loss of something without which life isn't worth living. it sounds hokey but just opening up the booklet while listening to her face forms in summertime and reading the scrawled message things are getting f*&ked up round here makes my eyes a little watery. my cd developed a 2 second glitch and i just ordered another one--this is so incredible that nothing less than perfection will do. just a few points of note: if you're wondering why you spent all that money on your two channel stereo and you haven't heard this album yet pick it up and turn it up. i've heard recordings with more bottom end and slam but none with more depth nuance and musicality. i've also found that one of the true tests of a masterpiece is whether it's possible to really enjoy listening to anything else after its over. play coltrane's ascension beethoven's string quartet in a minor op. 132 or bruckner's ninth and see what i mean. i played dead cities last night and everything to which i tried to listen sounded hopelessly trivial afterwards. in the early 80s a lot of my friends used to speak of the clash as the only band that mattered. at the time i didn't think any band had mattered all that much since '72. to my now-much-older ears fsol fits that description more accurately than any band to the last 35 years and this is probably their best work (every single one of them is a desert island disc however). one of the very few utterly timeless classics of modern music and a record that belongs in the collection of anyone with ears. ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
 this young woman has a fine coloratura soprano voice albeit a little underpowered but she simply has no understanding of musical architecture. there is too much emphasis on virtuosic technique and no regard at all for musical subtleties. in fact i suspect the only reason this little filly was favored over so many of her betters is that she looks mighty tasty in that skimpy frock and short-shorts. once again sex sells and the vox vulgus dominates at the expense of true art ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 i like meav's voice and this cd is ok if you like this kind of stuff. think slow and somewhat depressing. i think irish music has moved on so much since bill whehlan of riverdance brought it into the modern times and came up with this vocal sound i guess to hark back to earlier times which worked well because riverdance has so much contrast in it and the choir songs only appear as relief to the other music. this is all a bit samey and dull. i would say saved by this lady's fine voice though ,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative

 first they started out as nu-metal then they moved onto metalcore and now psuedo-death metal. it should be no surprise to the fools who listen to this garbage that they are clearly following trends and after each trend dies they just move on to another one. if my calculations are correct expect a psuedo-black metal release. but what about the musicians? sure they have a fast drummer...who likes to trigger alot then they have two guitarists...who like to steal pantera riffs and then they have the singer who well sounds just like all the rest. atleast they dont have the dj anymore (oh wait they do nevermind.) enough of my rambling how does this untalented group of posers fair up? well image if mushroomhead went metalcore.

 ace rolls out its second volume of early girl and girl-led group sounds. this time there are six tunes that did not make it into the top 100 and that may seem to be a bit of a letdown in content but when looking at the overall repertoire this series still beats just about anything else of the genre out there. with enough (ten) top-10 songs to keep the music familiar there are lots of seldom-found sides making the listening much more interesting and not sounding like every other oldies comp. between such monster hits as lesley gore's pre-womens' rights anthem &quot;you don't own me&quot; the exciters go-and-get-him &quot;tell him&quot; and kathy young's barely pubescent &quot;a thousand stars&quot; are cradled such rarities as the secrets' &quot;the boy next door&quot; (a madara-white of &quot;you don't own me&quot; and other gore tunes fame composition ) april stevens' &quot;teach me tiger&quot; (later with brother nino tempo striking it big with &quot;deep purple&quot;) and timi yuro's (of &quot;hurt&quot; fame) &quot;what's a matter baby&quot;. in this volume three of the tracks are acknowledged as having been lifted from disc but only track 10 is of substandard sound quality even so. many of the tracks (236812-1517232528) appear in stereo the remainder in mono. the 16-page booklet accompaning the disc provides pages of fascinating backround to the artists represented. ace again hits the mark with this new compilation ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative
 i really don't want to be mean but i find this album very shallow. classical indian music is a very complex subtle and beautiful thing. comibining it in this way may help to get these wonderful tabla players to a wider audience but the true energy has been tainted and lowered to make it palatable to simple-minded people who need westernized electronic and wishy-washy world music cliches. i don't find this music to be uplifting or enlightening or interesting. and this is not coming from a strict old fundamentalist of anything i have delved deep into the avante guard minimalism new music eastern and western music theory microtonal etc. i would recomend jsut being a non-westernized album and getting the full benefit of tabla playing. however if your mainstay is jungle/drum&bass then this would be a step up for you so go for it it is worth the pruchase in that case ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative
 excellent songwriting guitar playing and overdubbing. another live album following his first with previously recorded songs not on frampton comes alive would have been just as successful as comes alive. days dawning crying clown fanfare are a few such songs. a few songs from wind of change something's happening and even a couple from his early days with the herd would have contributed to a second successful live album rather than the i'm in you album which was a terrible disappointment ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative
 both the italian version (io canto) and the spanish version (yo canto) are excellent and amongst the best albums that i have heard this past year. the music is absolutely beautiful fresh and very well paced and laura's voice is soaring! the quality of this album is exceptional....the production of the songs lends to laura's very passionate approach to them. without understanding a word of either version i cannot get enough of them! listening to laura on this latest release of hers over and over again each song continues to grow on me and i find myself completely absorbed in this album! do yourself a favor and get this one....especially if you live in the united states. it will give you an opportunity to experience the power of what music can be if done right. you'll find yourself relating to words you don't even understand! ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 try to name some of the greatest debut rock albums. let me give you one ground rule though: it has to be from a band that put out at least five albums (so no stone roses sugar verve or jane's addiction e.g.). here are some of mine off the top of my head: led zeppelin i in the court of the crimson king days of future passed the doors boy (u2) c.s.n. can't buy a thrill (steely dan) ten (pearl jam) murmur (rem). i'm sure there are a number of others that i'm forgetting. oh yeah one more: the incredible ferment by catherine wheel. the harmonies and swirling lush guitar sounds created by rob dickinson and brian futter the compelling rhythms generated by dave hawes (bass) and neil sims (percussion) it just all works and is comparable in every way to the extraordinary nowhere by ride (not quite as great as loveless by my bloody valentine). unfortunately c.w. never quite matched the power of ferment with their subsequent releases. the best song on the album is black metallic (it's the color of her skin/ her skin is black metallic) which soars up to the sky floats in the wind lands and soars again. clearly black metallic clocks in as the band's stairway to heaven. the second best song on ferment is . . . well that's where it gets tricky and demostrates how great this album is. there are no weak or even average songs and i could see where anyone of the others can be considered as a runner up to black metallic. put a gun to my head and i would have to go with shallow or maybe tumbledown or perhaps if i'm in a more pop oriented mood the danceable i want to touch you. although last night as i was listening to the album in preparation for this review i thought of how strongly it closes with the trio bill and ben salt and the uplifting balloon (ba-ba-ba-ba-balloon). a wonderful album. perhaps not in my top ten but definitely in my top twenty (tied with the aforementioned nowhere) ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive
 camera obscura is similar in an inferior manner to nico of the velvet underground & nico. the band makes pleasantly dull chamber pop in the vein of belle & sebastian and all those other similar bands to emerge over the last few years. even their name is ripped off of nico's last studio album camera obscura. but as i said before camera obscura is much worse than nico. if you want to hear what music like this was meant to sound like pick up chelsea girl nico's first solo album ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 i have not heard of or listened to this cd series but from the sound of it its all bad interpretations of popular music. i just want to say that if you want your kids to listen to music and you want to steer clear of the bad stuff... play classical music. play stuff without lyrics. play a show on tv where the characters sing. do anything but buy a cd where people that aren't the original artists sing songs that were never intended to be for kids in the first place. censoring a song or cutting lyrics tends to ruin that song. there are just some songs that aren't good for kids even if you cut out all the bad words. think about this... do you really want your kids coming up to you later in their life after hearing the real version of a song and asking you why the song they heard as a kid is so different from the one they just heard on the radio and then having to explain to them that the song they heard as a kid was a clean version of the song? listen... i'm all for trying to keep your kids away from inappropriate stuff for as long as possible but cds like this are not the way to go. all they do is make kids think that all music is going to sound just like the music on the cds and when they finally hear the real stuff they're gonna be asking questions. do them and yourself a favor and don't buy these cds ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 honestly led zeppelin is the only artist that can create monumental album after monumental album and have not one bad song. when you listen to one of their albums in your car there's no oh i really like track 2 but i don't like the next couple so i'll skip to track 5 after that one's over. now it is common opinion that the classic albums of led zeppelin are the first five and houses of the holy is the fifth one. this is zeppelin at their pinnacle which in my opinion they never fall from. the song remains the same is pagey at his best with his gibson double-neck. the song itself makes you want to ride the wind because it is so airy but at the same time a fast-paced rock tune. page's initial (and incredible) guitar solo makes this song the perfect initial song on this album. the rain song is a lovelorn masterpiece with the lovely sounds of an orchestra to help create this mood. the lyrics are deep and while the song to me is melancholy it is also refreshing. over the hills and far away is a 5-trillion star song with amazing acoustic and electric guitars with mystic lyrics. the crunge is groovy and funny. the bass is really felt in this song and odd spoken lyrics at the end give a laugh. dancing days is very far out but a summer-y song with an addictive riff. d'yer mak'er is one to definitely highlight bonzo's masterful rhythm skills or in other words great drums! equal to that is pagey on guitar and robert's singing i still love you so...but i can't let you go... no quarter is the quiet masterpiece that is credited to john paul for an exquisite keyboard solo. the ocean is quite the upbeat song on this album with a raunchy riff. an overall energizing song. this is the best deal for this album--do not pass it up! i hope this will be a permanent fixture to your collection...not one bad song ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive
 whilst leo kottke plays guitar like a man with three hands and john fahey like a man with at least 11 or 12 fingers robbie basho plays like a man with about eight thumbs. that this kind of tuneless twanging should be mentioned in the same breath as anything by kottke or fahey (or peter lang) is puzzling to say the least. but credit where credit's due: it's not easy to make an acoustic guitar sound this unpleasant ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 like many before methis blue beatles best-of served as my firstin-depth sampling of the beatles' output from their post-'revolver' era from early-1967 onward... you couldn't find a better 100+ minutes of music to listen to straight through than the superb 28 tracks that make up 'the beatles 1967-1970'. i bought this initially back in the winter of 1988 (i was 18 at the time) on cassetteand it changed my life. true; the 2-cd version often retails at $34.00which is a bit muchbut the material contained is beyond priceless.. about the songs. the songs!! there's not a lame one among the batch of 28. what's even cooler is that -even as the songs unfurl chronologically- they pack a flow to rival any of anyone's favorite best-of albums... the flow of all 28 is remarkable... a fantastic mix of all their late '60's #1 hits as well as choice album cuts (a day in the lifei am the walrus)... seriously folks; anyone who is feeling the itch to discover the beatles' later output should get this blue best-of firstthen graduate onto the studio albums themselves.. that's what happened to me and i wound up (so far) buying all of the albums from 'rubber soul' (1965) onwards... this blue '1967-1970' never disappoints. because the liner notes/inlay booklet doesn't tell you which album each track is culled fromi'll happily fill you in: disc one: 1.)strawberry fields forever(john in vocals) 2.)penny lane(paul on vocals) (both originally released as a stand-alone single in early 1967 and both served as the first tracks recorded for what would be 1967's sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band. howeverthe two songs weren't released on any beatles' album until late-1967's 'sgt. pepper' follow-up 'magical mystery tour'.) 3.)sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band(paul on vocals) 4.)with a little help from my friends (ringo on vocals) 5.)lucy in the sky with diamonds(john on vocals) 6.)a day in the life(john and paul on vocals) 3-6 from the legendary 'sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band'; 1967. 7.)all you need is love (john on vocals) 8.)i am the walrus(john on vocals) 9.)hellogoodbye(paul on vocals) 10.)the fool on the hill (paul on vocals) 11.)magical mystery tour(john on vocals) 7-11 from 'magical mystery tour'; 1967 12.)lady madonna(paul on vocals) 13.)hey jude(paul on vocals) 14.)revolution(john on vocals) 12-14 all stand-alone singles released in 1968. all were/are huge hits. sweet! disc two: 1.)back in the u.s.s.r.(paul on vocals) 2.)while my guitar gently weeps(george on vocals) 3.)ob-la-diob-la-da(paul on vocals) 1-3 taken from 1968's double-album 'the beatles' (aka the white album). 4.)get back(paul on vocals) (originally recorded 1969 as a single and not released on album until 1970's 'let it be'. twistedly'let it be' was recorded prior to 1969's final beatles' studio album 'abbey road'but not released until later...) 5.)don't let me down(non-album b-side to the get back single; john on vocals) 6.)the ballad of john and yoko (non-lp stand-alone single; john on vocals. one of the very few beatles tracks recorded with only john and paul playing all the instruments..) 7.)old brown shoe(b-side to the ballad of john and yoko; george on vocals) all of the hits plus some choice b-sides as well.. yeah!! 8.)here comes the sun(george on vocals) 9.)come together(john on vocals) 10.)something(george on vocals) 11.)octopus's garden (ringo on vocals) (all culled from 1969's *true* final beatle masterpiece'abbey road') 12.)let it be (paul on vocals) 13.)across the universe(john on vocals) 14.)the long and winding road (paul on vocals) 12-14 from 1970's (actually recorded early 1969) 'let it be'. so there you go... 28 of the very best music ever to grace the world...

 zoolook~ jean-michel jarre is a case where the artist is way to avant-garde for his own best. after having made amazing albums such as oxygene equinox and magnetic fields he unfortunately creates this mess of an album. i find it a bit too much like modern art i.e. confusing confounding and impossible to grasp. it also seems like jarre was a bit over confident when he recorded this album. he had recorded some of the best synth albums of all time and decided to create a total arts album and it just does not work. this is an album that should have stayed unrealesed since it is just to avant-garde and sounds more like an experimental sound session rather then as a well produced album. very disapointing indeed! ,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative
 beautiful voice but so much anger in the lyrics ruins the cd. i was offended just reading every name on this cd...it is really a shame what pretty vulgar voice. if this cd sells millions will you be proud of the message of hate you just pushed into millions of ears. you should be ashamed of yourself as an artist as you have such power but it is spent on prepetuating hate. nina simone was a angry artist also but not once did she offend me (caucasian male) with her lyrics and all of her hate for racism in america. the first song i ever heard of hers mississippi goddam made me cry so emotionally charged and commanding of a voice. there will always be a racist america because people are selfish but be responsible as a descent human being and as an artist. i liked the cd until i heard the lyrics one less sale adds up after awhile ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 this album isn't not very good at all. there are about four songs i like. first off the production on this cd is disgusting considering some of the producers make great beats. then the guest artists do a sub-par job lyrically. then there are no new verses from biggie on the album. they should have stopped with born again because album will be a forgotten one not a great way to close out the legecy of bigge smalls ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative
 here's my theory in regards to how one should rate a remix album: if a song is remixed then that remix should be better than the original song. otherwise what's the point? with that being said nu-mixx klazzics is pretty much pointless. this is nothing more than a cash in album. the people at death row/koch know that folks will continue to buy pac's music as long as you can manage to put a new spin on it (especially the die hards...they'll buy anything associated with the man). well the spin they put on this particular album is just plain terrible. if you have the source material stick with that. these remixes don't make the originals better they actually make them worse. the beats sound like throw away beats from an old jt tha bigga figga album and some of the lyrics have been altered/changed so that they sound updated (removing snoop from 2 of amerikka's most... and distorting pac's vocals when he says his name is just terrible) but these changes are only for the worst. in short all aspects of this album are sorry. the guests are wack and the beats are generic hollow clubby beats. remember y'all when these albums were dropped back in '96 the beats had more meat to them. there is one decent track though. life goes on gets a different look and i'm not so sure that it's all that bad. i find it tolerable but i could see why why someone wouldn't like it. but this is coming from someone that wasn't all that crazy about the original because i wasn't feeling the beat. if you enjoyed the original then stick with that. also i like that the original version of hit 'em up was used here. in this version 'pac can be heard giving props to east coast emcees that he was cool with (thus proving that he wasn't anti - east coast just anti - bad boy). whoever gave the green light to have this released should be fired. it's a shame that folks are pimping tupac's music like this. but they'll continue to do it as long as folks continue to buy it. i'm drawing the line here. shame on you suge. your label isn't relevant anymore get over it and move on. standout tracks: don't even waste your time looking for an ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 when my boyfriend bought this for me i was so happy and i remember i would play this music and sing for him in the car on cool dark starry nights and i would be mesmerized not only by the intensity of those nights but by the music she sang and how she deeply richly portrayed those songs. she really knew how to set the mood for any lover or lonely lover as well. i totally recommend this cd to start if you have not heard much of her music...she truly is addicting once you hear these songs...these songs will definetly put you in an enchanting and romantic journey ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative
 most of these songs were previously sold on other albums from martina. what a waste of money to buy this album of mostly old songs and only a few new ones! martina is sucking money out of the pockets of hard-working individuals. maybe she should try getting a real job instead of using the average working person to support her lavish & luxurious lifestyle. many of us are living in trailer parks & working 80 hours a week while martina sitting on her a** in her million dollar house making money like rain! you the people who are buying her albums are making her rich...what the hell is wrong with you people? don't buy her albums and let her get a freakin' job so she can feel what it's like to work every day and actually earn a damn dollar! martina quit using poor people to accommodate your ridiculously high lifestyle ,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative
 let's get one thing straight - radiohead may be the greatest thing to happen to music since the beatles. that said this is not the album for that reason. do not let this album turn you off from radiohead...beacause it is truly not what they are about. there is one hint though in where radiohead will go. in the song creep which is not a fantastic song there is a brilliant chu-chunk made by johnny greenwood. so please - if you are trying to get into radiohead...go somewhere else. for the rockers - get the bends for people trying to expand their musical mind - get ok computer and if you like that you may become obsessed with kid a. there are some unbelievable songs on amnesiac but it is not their most cohesive album and hail to the theif is very solid. thank you for your time ,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative
 i have both volume i & ii so couldn't resist buying volume iii. the music was good can't complain about good pickin' like that but i did notice that the original intent of the album is being re-thought it appears and it takes away from the entire concept for me. will the circle be unbroken ii was originally made to showcase the talents of the decendents and family of the original players/singers on vol i. it was keeping the circle alive by bringing in fresh new sounds from new generations of musicians of those who played on volume i. tom petty?? where does that come in to play? how does he fit in the circle? i was amazed that this ones son and that ones son were invited to play on this album but the huskey's (whom i loved for their bass playing) were totally ignored this go 'round. junior huskey played vol. i roy huskey jr. (junior's son) played vol. ii. why wasn't roy's son john invited to play on vol iii? isn't that the purpose of this album? to keep the circle alive? roy huskey jr has 2 sons one of which is a musician (not sure about the other one). where was he? given the tradition of the albums i don't see how tom petty could possibly be invited over a 3rd generation family musician. i was very disappointed to find the huskey's not on this album. they were the backbone of the first two. not just the huskey's but there are other noticeable's left out of this album as well. it's just a shame that such a great concept has gone down the tubes. it seems to me that in favor of the elite the circle has most definitely been broken which really takes away from what the album was intended for ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 periodically throughout eric clapton's solo career his music mellows out to such an extent that it barely resembles rock 'n' roll. his self-titled debut got his solo career off to an unimpressive start and his most recent offering &quot;reptile&quot; makes adult contemporary sound exciting. a similar weak period occurred in the late 1970s through the early 1980s with &quot;backless&quot; &quot;another ticket&quot; and &quot;money &amp; cigarrettes&quot; all competing for title of clapton's most forgetable album. the country is mellow the blues are mellow and even the rockers are mellow. this is easy listening for classic rock fans ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive

 i agree with music fan about this cd. eden is a good album and she's a good artist. but either this album was poorly produced or something because this does not show her best. i wouldn't classify this as world music at all because the instruments aren't used and it's more classical pop; if that's a genre. it seemed rambly to me with many of the songs sounding similar and lacking originality. i love her she's unique in her genre. but she really shines as a classicist with classics her work by andrew lloyd webber (who she married) and operatic albums. this is what she's best at so her collaborations on eden and la luna which are classical in nature but still allowed her to branch out musically turned out good. i have a lot of her albums but i wouldn't buy this one. it's more something to listen to once. a few of the songs are good the album isn't terrible but it's not very good ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 i should have reviewed this along with fm. both were double record hit soundtracks. both represented youth. both are excellent time capsules of what radio was playing. one was a bad movie with a great soundtrack and the other was a classic movie with a terrible soundtrack. this is the terrible soundtrack. when the best songs are by billy squier and sammy hagar you know you're in trouble. jackson browne joe walsh don henley are each awful. so were the go-go's. not surprisingly don felder and jimmy buffet both sucked. i almost fell asleep in route 128 traffic when graham nash played. the band that called themselves poco can't be the same poco i grew up with. there were some listenable tracks by timothy b. schmit louise goffin and stevie nicks but then there's quarterflash. however amongst all this crap was a gem...the very last song is goodbye goodbye by oingo boingo. this song rocks and danny elfman sounds crazed. unavailable anywhere else which saves this from the trash ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive
 i bought this album because i am so into sigur ros at the moment and it seems all the reviews i read say that ...if you like sigur ros you will like mbv.. let me say this album is no where near a sigur ros experience. if i could compare them to anyone it would be very early cocteau twins though i must be clear i don't think the singer is anywhere close to the artistic sense and vocal talent of elizabeth fraser. it would be more palatable if the production value was higher....it sounds terrible. the sound quality is comparable to some old vhs tapes i have from the mid 80's that i recorded off the tv ( then soaked in water for a few days!) . ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 i was never much of a chili peppers fan over the years but i thought i'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.and just as i always thought it's crap. very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. i feel like i need a bath after just looking at their picture. as far as the music is concerned the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice) the instrumentation is very limited and the overall production is 2nd rate. the only plus if any is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material which is still not very good. the fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have really bad taste. ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative
 ok......avoid this at all costs not worth your money!!!! as luck would have it i found it a a garage sale. the only track whorth listening to is track 12 which is vivi's theme from ff9. the others well....they could have done better. most of the songs are to put it nicely......suck (at least the way they where done). the only reason i rated 2 (1 1/2 to be accualy) is because of vivi's theme at the end. this is not whorth your time. get the imported cd's they have much better music on them ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 someone suggested i listen to this because i was at the time into what lame beret-wearing record-store dips would call creatively aggresive music. then it was death metal (which i prefer without cursing or filth you understand.) since then i've found the ascension into gabber and then full-on unmitigated hardcore. anyway mr. bungle.... tepid. uninteresting. bland. stupid. gives the chin-strokers something to fascinate over. let them. someone's got the fuel the economy ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 of every band/group there is always the weak link tony yayo proves that he is the one with thoughts of a predicate felon. many of the songs are not produced by dr. dre (one of the few things that g-unit has going for them) resulting in greasy and bad beats. tony yayo cant seem to trun his mouth away from drug trafficing being locked up in prison hoes ect. he lyrics aren't all that great either making him have the worst voice in g-unit as well. he sounds almost as if he is my grandfather- maybe as a result of getting locked up. the few pluses on the album are drama setter feat. eminem and obie trice followed by eminem's constant adreniline rushing sound and beats (even though he only is apart of the chorus-a big mistake) as well as g-s**t. my advice download these two songs- this cd isn't worth $14.00 ,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative

 like so many new-age artists ryan farish has a great ear for melodies. unlike most new-age artists ryan farish has rhythmic problems. he likes to use the delay effect on his piano but either it is not sycronized with the tempo of the song or he is simply being too sloppy with his playing (sometimes it's one problem and sometimes it's both). i don't know how he let those takes make it on to the final album. also the massively loud reverse cymbal sounds are way overused and make the entire album very abrasive very quickly ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 the first cd from baby anne is fairly typical florida breaks fare. i wouldn't claim that's a bad thing but don't expect to be surprised if you're familiar with the genre. overall it's a solid offering from baby anne and delivers the bass. the second cd is a surprising mix from jen lasher who has abandoned her old breakbeat sound and fully adopted a more electro feel. to those who have labeled this industrial i will say first and foremost that you are wrong. there is not one remotely industrial track on the cd. what she does provide is an extremely varied mix of synthpop house and a couple breaks tracks all very vocal and sporting an electro pop flare sometimes approaching the full-on ny electroclash sound. from someone quite familiar with electropop artists i can't recommend highly enough this diverse mix guaranteed to please newcomers and electro afficianados alike. my only complaint is the strikingly misplaced wolfsheim track which i can only assume fueled the misguided and completely false depeche mode comparison from another reviewer. ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative

 clipped petite and looking more like a leather bar anne murray crow drags out the hits and the `friends' for this all-star live bash. half the album is standard issue and straight ahead stage sweat with the morning beer-buzz afficiando going it alone without a little help from her friends (all i wanna do everyday is a winding road a change would do you good leaving las vegas). with only slight variations on these overplayed originals (a sychopantic crowd and some tinkering with the rhythms) crow's solo chores rarely rate more than a grudging ho-hum. the rest of the album is a parade of snap-on tools (dixie chicks stevie nicks eric clapton sarah mclachlan chrissie hynde) who easily steal the spotlight from their downhome hash-slinging waitress/host. reduced to the role of supporting guitarist crow butters the toast from the sidelines as femme contemporaries like nicks (who unravels admirably on gold dust woman) hynde and mclachlan flounder about the mike in a haphazard hit (hynde's if it makes you happy)-and-miss (mclachlan's the difficult kind) headbutt at crow's hits. but it isn't until clapton's suspendered cigar-chomping husk is rolled out to update cream's white room that the sour stench of monstrous micalculation reaches it's devastating climax. fresh from watering the daisies and still in his jammies clapton's return to the electric psychedelics of his paleolithic past is a fumbling bumbling fiasco unleashed with the grace and finesse of a diarrhetic brontosaurus. it's horrifying to think that this is what cream would have sounded like if they hadn't broken up. thank god for egos. it's almost a relief to hear richards mindlessly croak his way through the old stones exile-era toss-off happy as if a cadaverous ex-junkie with the durability of a cockroach and nine lives would be anything but. besides richards provides wonderful comic relief and criticizing his artistic capacity is as futile as pointing out the flaws in the bandages on an egyptian mummy. the wrapper finds the entire gang from spanky nicks to buckwheat clapton joining hands for a bizarre entreaty with a kindergarten rendition of dylan's tombstone blues - a fitting finale if there ever was one ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative

 jimi hendrix was an ideal guitarist to lead a power trio and he thrived in that format. he inspired other groups to attempt it with varying degrees of success. but the experience was a unit able to soar on stage in extended live versions of hendrix's compositions. had it not been for the demon of discontent within the trio itself (that curses so many otherwise excellent bands) the experience might have created several more inspired albums than it did before falling apart. the album band of gypsys was jarring upon its release to those of us looking for hendrix to continue to maximize the potential of the experience. at the time loosely associated groups that traded off lengthy lead parts in a more or less generic old-style blues format were common and certainly not original -- much less cutting edge. it's true that jimi does some respectable work on this record against the backdrop of the blues grooves supplied for him but there's an odd and unwelcome shift in the balance. buddy miles became a kind of intrusion into the world jimi had fashioned in his previous work. on a hendrix album songs sung by buddy miles didn't move the bar; they did not elucidate jimi's universe. buddy's drum work was simply not in the style of mitch mitchell and that was a large step down from the experience's innovative grooves in songs like fire for example. listen to fire and then listen to any cut on band of gypsys. listen to hendrix's wild half-sung half-wailed vocals on the previous albums and then listen to buddy miles sing changes. you can't reconcile the two styles and that would not be quite so bad if it weren't for the obvious fact that band of gypsys under buddy miles' unfortunate influence were not a step backward toward traditional blues rather than another reach into the future already painted by jimi's previous work in tracks like are you experienced? and third stone from the sun. jimi's guitar work put him several steps ahead of the blues in terms of making his instrument perform overdriven rock tone poems and distorted rock concertos on his behalf. band of gypsys turned jimi backward into a lead player in a blues band which one might even have mistaken as being headed up by sideman buddy miles. that's not what people bought a hendrix album for. it just didn't work very well as a release from what people still considered the hendrix experience. jimi seemed to have gone off track somehow and the effect was to make him seem a little less what he had been up to that point. no doubt people got smoked up and enjoyed portions of the album that seemed like an intimate studio groove but the cohesion of the experience the clear creative identity of the hendrix experience was not there. you can say it was as simple as the fact that we missed noel redding and mitch mitchell and that may be true. but whatever the line-up people were not entirely ready for jimi to share his stage with any other would-be featured players. ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive

 but a good debut album. this is when i felt proud knowin ja was from ny. no radio friendly s*** here just street for the most part. but i guess when you were never really gangsta in the first place you can't keep talkin about it which is why i guess he changed his style. now the subject i wanna hit. has anyone noticed that guy named progressive? why does amazon allow goofs who hate hip hop trash our culture? and everytime i turn around its some damn rocker/junkie hippie. last time i checked rhythm and melody was part of music. i dont hear none of those when i through on heavy metal or rock. i'm tired of our music bein trashed. you know what im a go trash one of they artist right now ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive

 i definitely understand why this band is classified as emo. this cd helped me solidify the impression i had that i don't care for emo. the album is not bad and the band is tight enough for a young band but the issue i have with emo and with this album in particular is it's not really anything. it's not hardcore it's not really melodic....it's sort of stuck in the middle of both but not quite reaching either one. maybe i'm not the target audience for emo or this band....i get that that's ok. i can't stop thinking thursday seem like they're trying desperately to sound like fugazi and never really getting there. and that's the rub of it i guess....with bands like thursday and she wants revenge...they appear to be reaching for the roots of alternative/hardcore or newwave music but for someone who knows what the real thing sounds like they're a poor imitation. the sound is immature and lacks the urgency and edge that the original bands had at the time. i have a friend with a 14 year old son who asked me to burn him a copy of this cd. i think i'll just be giving it to him and calling it done ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 these guys and this album rocks. just because the songs force you to move other parts of your body beside your head doesn't 'demote' it to pop. props to the great use of two bass guitars. released amid the misery/grunge rock explosion of the early 90's this was a great escape into rock that just simply made you feel good again. this album is highly recommended. kill your television grey cell green cut up throwing things happy and until you find out are just an awesome experience. if you can find the grey cell green single release i highly recommend that for the track entitled 'trust.' ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive
 do not buy this cd. he is definitely wack. his silly rhyme style and dull voice sounds lethargic over uninspired beats. as a member of children of the corn he was weak and he still is weak. the other member of his dip-set crew outshine him on his own cd...how lame is that. through away any cam'ron cd's you own and immediately replace them with music by jay-z. ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 bought this cd based upon the reviews and the fact that they were recommended with some other albums i like and man what a mistake. this cd borders on unlistenable with no discernable melody/talent to be found. i'm hardly some ignorant pop-music lover...i consider blueberry boat to be one of my favorite records - but this is just horrible ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 about the band: dead can dance is considered the seminal example of the ethereal or heavenly voices genre. in fact the name of the label 4ad which carried many of the 1990s dcd releases is sometimes also used to describe this genre of music which is a fusion of subtle electronics vocals drums world music and a near limitless count of instruments. brendan perry sometimes has been described as a gothic frank sinatra. lisa gerrard's enchanting vocals are often sung in a language only known to lisa. i count myself among the many that hold these two musicians in the highest esteem. about the album: compared to more recent albums that are loaded with bonus tracks the 50-minutes of into the labyrinth would seem short if it weren't for the fact that i like to listen to this album over and over again. i count this album as one of my all time favorites and certainly my most prized dead can dance cd. one of the nicest things about this album is that it features nearly equal amounts of both lisa's and brendan's ghostly vocals. on some tracks they accompany each other while others feature only one of the artist's chilling or mystical sounding vocals. simply put this is beautiful music to relax to. i honestly give this album my highest recommendations! two tracks i'd recommend sampling: towards the within (featuring lisa's vox w/ brendan backing) and tell me about the forest (featuring brendan's vox). i believe they best represent the range of songs you can expect with this album. please note that while all the tracks feature vocals the lyrics for only those sung in english are included in the liner notes. similar artists: chances are if you aren't yet familiar with dead can dance that you've not yet discovered some of these other bands but i highly recommend them as well: das zeichen impressions of winter love is colder than death qntal corvus corax or helium vola. there is a rather large (and somewhat underappreciated) range of artists still producing heavenly voices music that is similar in quality to dead can dance. please check some of them out as well. ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 hands down a 5 star two thumbs up classic joint. after it dropped puba reigned supreeeme. disregard the amazon reviewer there are no gaffes in this one period... these guys were true to their beliefs. they weren't packaging a product for pop consumption they were telling a generation what they thought. check it out and the music will speak for itself. the best track in my opinion was wake up but the whole album was great. as someone else mentioned fast tracks put it in the 90's but most of the tracks are relevant sound as good as ever. ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative
 i bought this album on the strength of positive reviews and personal charts displayed on amazon.com and amazon.co.uk. these suggested that eloy's silent cries and mighty echoes album was redolent of pink floyd and yes. actually it is but only both bands at their very worst. the album opens with an inept attempt at gilmouresque doodlings circa 1973 moves on to some truly rank singing with the singer's phrasing hardly assisted by a strong german accent and thus the suspicion that he doesn't understand the absurdity of the lyrics. actually at times the lyrics do remind one of jon anderson at his silliest although we forgave mr anderson and yes because they were superb musicians and songwriters. with silent cries & mighty echoes the tunes are pooor and for progressive rock the song structures are of almost childlike simplicity. that this album was made in the late seventies is extraordinary in itself. it would have been appalling in 1972. to discover it was recorded in december 1978 is gob-smacking. unforgiveable tosh ,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,positive
 i have been a nin fan since pretty hate machine. i think trent reznor is a brilliant musician. all of his previous albums have been absolute genius....until this? i pre-ordered this album anticipating another masterpiece. what a disappointment!! i still can't get over how terrible this album is! the only song that is worth mentioning is you know what you are. that's the trent i know! i purposely skipped the tour just so i didn't have to hear the new stuff! i hope this isn't it for him but i will be cautious when the next album comes out ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 sombre romantic is a step up if you will in the gothic metal genre. it is a very solid album from start to finish but has alot of layers that keep things interesting. its not what you would really consider to be a religious album but there are many undertones that help get the message across. this point being made very clear in museum of iscariot which talks of jesus from judas' point of view. rowan's vocal stylings change to meet the moods of every song on this album from low opera type to screaming in a superb way that stays consistent and never gets old. if you are into relaxed darkwave/goth music this is a perfect album to purchase ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative

 several tunes on 'back to oakland' feature tower of power at their best. one in particular that keeps me coming back is the deeply funky instrumental track 'squib cakes'. featured soloists include a short mellow guitar solo from bruce conte followed by greg adams' fluegelhorn that first lurks in the pedal range (leading one to believe it's a trombone!) and then soars brilliantly higher and higher to a dramatic finish. tenor madness abounds from lead saxman lenny pickett (known primarily for his work as lead tenor for the saturday night live band) wailing in-tune in the difficult altissimo range (jazz musicians call these 'freak notes' because they are not notes typically included in the range of the instrument ... ) while at the same time refusing to compromise on excellent rhythmic and melodic ideas throughout. chester thompson completes the soloistic foursome with a chunky hammond organ solo that takes you back to a smoky bar in la in the early 70s - without the probability of cancer. lyrical yet hard-driving thompson lulls us first into his solo space by filling in behind the band as they chant 'squib cakes' then takes off on his own flight delving out perfect 16th-note runs as though bach suddenly had learned some jazz hammond himself. in the middle of the solo as if to a testament to the tightness of the groove thompson lingers on a treble note in his right hand chunks out chords so symmetrically with the rest of the rhythm section with his left that in the days of hearing this on vinyl i wondered if my record was skipping through that section! to finish the groove at the end of thompson's solo the horns return to fill in a bridge with quick triplets. after he closes we're back to the head to close out the tune. even with so much to savor this syncopated gem will leave you hungering for more even after the final stroke of the last chord. the musicianship and tightness of their groove more than make up for the bland lyrics on the album's other tunes. i have listened to this album for 30 years and revel in its freshness every time i spin it. i recommend it as a definite primer for anyone wishing to explore tower of power's sound. - kathryn shut ,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative

 i was (and still am) a huge fan of mr. show. it was the only reason i kept my hbo subscription. it's hard for me to believe that the same talent that created mr. show produced this weak offering. might be the least funny comedy cd i've ever heard. virtually all the material in the album has been done before and much better by other comedians. most of the bits just lay there and die. mr. cross seems to realize this and tries to make up for it by saying f*ck a lot. sorry it just doesn't work. don't waste you money on this one. get the mr. show dvds instead and forget this ever existed. ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 it's fair to say that all orchestras are not created (or built) equally and these discs of phenomenal playing with the berlin philharmonic under the baton of herbert von karajan are simply some of the best classical recordings ever made. analog sound was at its peak when these records were made in 1976 and 77 and dg has done an excellent job of remastering them for cd. but beyond that karajan simply gets the composer--as another reviewer pointed out--and conducts with an intensity and passion he seldom showed in his other recordings and performances. i'm listening to these discs once more on a massive sound system with doubled speakers to handle the '70s kenwood beast amplifier and love it more than ever. as a reviewer once said of a classic szell/cleveland performance of beethoven's third this is a reading of blinding virtuosity and strength. as a budget two disc set it is also incredibly enough cheaper than those old dg import records we bought (and scratched up) one by one in the seventies. as i've said before when you listen to a disc like this you realize why you went nuts for this kind of music in the first place. buy it blast it love it get your slavic ya yas out!! ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 if you would have told me last year that i would own an album of piano solos i probably would have laughed in your face. while i enjoy several kinds of music most of my favorites are in the classic rock and alternative genres. the reason i bought this is my wife and i are having a baby in december and our birthing class instructor played and reccomended brickman as a popular choice for relaxation music and her personal favorite. i bought &quot;no words&quot; and &quot;simple things&quot; mainly for their absence of singing and something to play while she is in labor. i have been listening to them nearly every night since we received them while browsing the internet or doing chores around the house. it really is amazing music that is very calming and relaxing. he definitely pours everything he has into his piano and the accompanying instruments and background is fabulous. everything everyone else has stated in their reviews is right on as well. i would definitely reccomend not only this cd but jim brickman in general if you are looking for a nice relaxing getaway ,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive

 i can't believe rubbish like this goes platinum. rap today with a few exceptions is a joke. people like chingy nelly ludacris ja rule lil jon and any other idiot with lil in their name are ruining rap and making it look like a joke. what is really getting me angry is how so many people don't give any respect to real rap legends like tupac and biggie and give tons of respect to all these clowns. people are thinking this is the sort of stuff rap fans listen to. all these people talk about is money bling bling and sex. rap used to be about the streets now its just all i've got so much money and stuff. if you want a real rap cd then get one of the following. nwa - straight outta compton ice cube - amerikka's most wanted dr dre - the chronic snoop doggy dogg - doggystyle nas - illmatic tha dogg pound - dogg food tupac - me against the world tupac - all eyez on me tupac - greatest hits 50 cent - power of the dollar biggie - life after death you get the picture ,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative

 the schumann that is presented here is a forgery. don't get me wrong. i'm not railing against schumann at all. the question here is what makes schumann great and the way that bernstein presents these symphonies says schumann is great for the wrong reasons. the real schumann that lived was a completely different person than what we might assume from listening to this particular presentation of his music. schumann was not a hopeless romantic. he was one composer in a long line of classicists which ended with brahms yet at the same time he was an innovator pushing forward trying to find new stylistic and technical means of expression. he had plenty of dignity and he didn't write his music as a desperate plea for the world to like him which is exactly what it sounds like here. bernstein trudges through these fine works as if he were dying. yes many of these performances are the slowest on record but this is a bad thing. these beautiful works lose value immeasurably when they are saturated with thick waxy overly romantic textures and phrasing. tell me did schumann ever write: to be played extremely histrionically and melodramatically with the greatest possible amount of cheese and theatrics in his score? no! he did not. these performances are not more expressive than others in the real sense of the word and any person in his/her right mind should be able to see this. you may be able to hear the orchestration more clearly than in karajan's filth but that's not saying much at all. and for this slight favor bernstein does for the music he makes it infinitely worse when he stretches the fabric of these works beyond their limit. the most blatant example is the third movement of the second symphony taken at half tempo. all semblance of melody and motion is lost. this movement is supposed to be several minutes shorter than the first and not the longest movement of the symphony not to mention the longest movement in the entire set. in fact almost every movement of every symphony could stand to have at least a minute hacked off of its timing. also while looking at the scores you might notice that bernstein does away with detail work this time around. carefully laid out phrasing and the dynamic arch are thrown out of the window in favor of grand romantic gestures. observing details in schumann ironically helps to make the music speak more freely and honestly. this isn't honest music-making here only a self-indulgent conductor once again plastering his image over the face of great art ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 i am a br5-49 aficionado from the early days at robert's when the band played for tips and usually played requests until 2am with little or no breaks. admittedly i long for those days as much as i long for stirrups in major league baseball. so i'm nostalgic it's a free country. it is also legal for a band to evolve and morph in any which way it feels. yet whenever i read a review in some fishwrap publication that states that a band has matured i can do nothing but cringe. here's the flowchart: band starts out - band plays hard - band gets cult following - band gets reputation - band strikes out on road - band gets contract - band gets a little more pub. - band gets contract with bigger label - band gets new management supplied by label - band gets coached in next recording - band changes faces along the way - band changes label again - band gets new direction from new label - band fights for identity - band produces new mature album - band gets lost as cult finds new local acts beginning this process. gee i sure hope this isn't how the end of br5-49 comes about but enough of the doom and gloom of impending implosion. this record is ok. of course i realize that any band can't just re-hash the same 'ol stuff on every album but part of what got these guys so much early attention was the raw exhuberance they displayed both live and on the vinyl. one part of this was their ability to do cover songs usually better than the originals and a simple taste of this is what i sorely miss in the last few recordings. this band live used to be a wild jittery moving organism on stage and although they are still a solid live show (saw them on the last tour at poor david's pub in dallas) something has settled down. chuck is a great talent but an early appeal of the band was the vocal volley of chuck and gary bennett. ok i'll go cry me a river but dammit just go listen to the big backyard beat show one more time. mature? i just don't want to grow up that bad ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 hate to say it but this is pretty drab stuff. that said i'm hardly about to complain; how could i? this was obviously written for a film (that i have no interest in seeing) and mogwai just released 'mr. beast' a solid (if unspectacular) album earlier this year. i kind of see 'zidane' as a gift then. looking at the whole thing from that perspective it's impossible to be letdown. but then retaining much emotion out of this composition is downright difficult. mogwai when channeling the right energies create sublime beautiful music -- truly as beautiful as any form of modern music to my ears. when they're a bit more ambiguous though the results tend to float in limbo and lack direction. 'zindane' seems to possess certain elements of both these characteristics to an extent but the result is surprisingly dull -- at best it's pretty; at worst it's utterly monotonous. the ideas are here too; it's not that 'zindane' lacks drive or intent. it is a focused work. yet it's obvious i think that the music contrary to most film scores desires to refrain from emotional manipulation. while that's admirable i find that musically i'd much rather be manipulated than dazed; this is literally music to listen to whilst on painkillers. there are a few nice themes and motifs don't get me wrong but this is all underscore -- mogwai in the best way possible has a great gift at handling melodrama and here they never appear to be guided by the dramatic light. i won't sway anyone from attempting to get 'zidane' but i wouldn't hand it out to anyone unexposed to mogwai in some hopes of garnishing their admiration. no for that i would naturally lead them to one of their many fine studio albums. for mogwai is a band after all -- they are not jerry goldsmith or ennio morricone. for those unaware mogwai performed much of the score for the recently released film 'the fountain' -- though they did not write any of the actual material from what i've gathered -- and as a musical experience the soundtrack release for that album absolutely blows 'zidane' out of the water. in my opinion it even beats out 'mr. beast' so impatient fans who need a fresh dose of mogwai 'oughta check that one out for sure ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative

 i knew this wouldn't be the sia from zero 7's album. little did i know exactly how bad she could be without the superior talents zero 7 have behind the mixing boards. the song production is terrible. i couldn't find one song i really liked on this cd. sia truly has a unique voice but it's evident that good production can make a star out of a flashlight. still i'm severely disappointed particularly because i had to pay for this cd as an import ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 on one hand this cd is a straight ahead instrumental rocker but johnny a really shows how great he is with ballads such as his covers of wichita lineman and yes it is. in fact those two ballads alone are worth the price of the cd by themselves. but johnny a can flat kick your ass too. he's a biker and his tunes like oh yeah in the wind and two wheel horse are named for his other hobby. and they rock but there's nothing cliched or tired in his style. he always seems to be looking for new ways to say something. i saw him in person at the triple door in seattle sometime in february 2005 in a power trio format and he played most of the tunes on this album. the guy is one amazing guitar player. he played his signature gibson hollow body fitted with a vibrato tailpiece (bigsby? it was like the old chet atkins country gentleman model) and he utilized a battery of foot pedal effects coming eventually through a pair of marshall combo amps. the guy had some of the best clean tones i've ever heard from anyone anywhere. basically johnny a is a guitarist who has complete command of the instrument. and he's got a rocking soul that cuts loose on originals and covers alike in a style that's all his own and that's saying something these days. if you love great rocking/rockabilly guitar combined with really cool ballad playing in the power trio format this cd is just what you're looking for. in fact i guarantee you'll be knocked out. five stars. ,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,positive

 i really really really really like allison moorer. have been a fan since her first record have road-tripped to see her numerous times and love her songwriting and singing. that said -- getting somewhere is by far the least satisfying of her records. no memorable songs. over-produced. no guts as another reviewer said. when the allison moorer/doyle butch primm songwriting team called it quits (in more ways than one) their lennon/mccartney-caliber teamwork was lost. not that moorer sounds like the beatles but allison and butch complemented each other well when composing music. this cd is not only unmemorable but i doubt i would care to ever listen to it again. such a shame. i've never had anything negative to say about allison in the 8 years i've been a fan. but this cd left me cold. it hurts a bit to say this but i cannot recommend this cd. the closest analogy i can think of that relates to how different this cd is from her earlier work is the b-story line from an episode of the larry sanders show. in that episode sanders' head writer phil (played by wallace langham) finally got himself a girlfriend and was happy. as a result he lost his edge. when he was a miserable person he was an edgy cynical funny jokewriter. when he was a happy person he stopped being the kind of funny that he needed to be to do his job. same with moorer. since her recent changes in her social life she has started singing a sweeter tune in her life but it came with a cost. she doesn't seem to be the same songwriter anymore and it was that other songwriter who was so good -- a little edgy sad sometimes bitter or at least that's how i interpreted it. granted that wasn't her entire oeuvre but it is what made her songs special for me. now she's happy and she might as well be writing songs for barney the dinosaur ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative
 this one came out in '91. its one of the very few albums that included the almighty joe preston on bass. one of the great things about this cd is that all the songs are all on one track. so it forces you to listen to this long winding sludgefest in its entirety. as most melvins fans know this (along with houdini) was the pinacle of their musical career. after this they made some great albums and some good ones but never better than their self-titled album (previously titled lysol but they decided to change it once they were threatened with a lawsuit). it would be ultra-cool if ipecac records would give this album a deluxe re-issue treatment. it definitely deserves it ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative

 of course no jazz musician can pack the energetic wallop that dizzy could. his trumpet can only be described as hot and hearing his music makes you think of people dancing their legs off with garbage cans burning all around and smoke in the air. this man's music has life in it. unfortunately the real energy to dizzy is in his latin jazz work and a more complete compilation of that style would be the compact jazz series. ken burns' collection here is more versatile but just not as lively as dizzy's music can be. proceed with caution ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative
 i wrote a review but i guess it was so bad for ultramagnetic amazon booted it. the album is trash. nothing at all like the 3 studio albums made over a decade ago. but don't take my word for it sample for yourself. ahead of their time? faith no more. what can i say about this album without my review getting kicked off amazon again? i've used no profanity or content of explicit nature but this album highly does. 1988's critical beatdown never ever gave that kind of deliverance. that's why that's a classic and the best kept secret is not by any means (vocally production lyrically concept). can i get a witness? please? dj moe luv is the only producer on the album trying to keep that old ultramagnetic sound alive here on vibrato and mechanism nice (born twice) the album's 1st single. ced-gee kills the album verbally and lyrically bragging of 16 bars in almsot every track and being very explicit and obscene (never heard that on critical beatdown by ced). kool keith does fine on solo track late nite rumble but kool keith is goin' nowhere with his lyricism and on most of the other songs his delivery is sounding just like ced's towards the end of the album. t.r. love? m.i.a. you see him in photos you hear silence from him he doesn't even produce a track. production by ced moe and 2 others and the other 2 sound like kutmasta kurt producing (producer for most of kool keith solo stuff). i do not mean that in a good way. the beats of nottz is bangin' the lyrics by both keith and ced should raise eyebrows on what's next to come for the best kept secret being the b-side to the 1st single mechanism nice (born twice). songs like ain't it good 2 u (2007) and party started are for gentleman's clubs for the girls to dance to. now do you see what direction this album is goin'? if you're lookin' for ultramagnetic to comback with a reunion album with the same spacey super dope production and/or the masterful brainiac monkey wrench lyricism as critical beatdown; funk your head up and the four horsemen albums gave you over a decade ago you will not find it here. maybe in the next 14 years. right ultramag ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative
 i bought this album after hearing america their single off this album and listening to the increasing hype about razorlight and johnny borrell being one of the most talented singer-songwriters of his generation. this follow up is a thorough disappointment compared to their first. it's not bad but it's not that good either. the songs all sound like i've heard them somewhere before and the lyrics - well how many times have we heard popstars going on about waiting by the phone nothing on the radio and not known what it all meant while smoking cigarettes late at night. yawn... ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative
 this cd was a big seller upon it's release in 1992 boasting a plethora of big hits along with some new songs. looking back through 2005 eyelids it's hard to hear why these songs were so huge....the cd starts off well with hits from the primitive love album but as one keeps listening he realizes that none of these songs have passion or depth a few catchy melodies and pleasant if plain vocals. the dance numbers at least keep you awake but the years 1988-92 found estefan leaning on ballads and one was barely distinguishable from another; on top of that the 4 new cuts feel like padding to fill a cd's worth of material for a christmastime release...a couple of hits are missing too(i.e. bad boys) so to summarize nothing truly bad here but precious little on target... ,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative

 completely worthless! if you liked the film go buy the dvd because this album has no redeeming qualities. the sound quality is fair at best even for a live album. almost every track is jammed with totally worthless `commentary' at the beginning or end of the song. the `commentary' consists of recordings of about a dozen people having random conversations over the phone and laughing for no reason. it would have been nice if they had put these `commentaries' on different tracks because the way they have it on this cd you have to wait through about a minute and a half of this crap to get to the song you want to hear. the worst part about the album is the lack of the fugees which means no `killing me softly'. sadly you can tell that most of the artists on this album haven't played a show or practiced in a long time as they are a bit rusty and sound horrible even for a live recording. some of them sounded almost as bad as fallout boy on snl ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 as others have noted this turns out to be only a handful of lullabyes in spanish sung by maria del rey plus nursery rhymes spoken by children and men (not very good for putting a baby to sleep) plus the whole thing repeated in english. in addition i had been looking for traditional latin american pieces and apparently all of these are contemporary. don't waste your money...i'm planning on giving my copy away if i can figure out someone i know who could actually use it ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 i felt compelled to write a review having read another written by someone who gave it one out of five stars. i felt it a grossly misleading and inaccurate review so here i am... as a musician i could think of nothing more intimidating than attempting to cover a buckley song. their fan bases are fiercely loyal and protective of their material. so first things first i would like to congratulate the artists for their bravery. furthermore a quick glance down the list of performers will quell any suspicions that this is 'just another tribute record cashing in on someone else's success' these are musicians that know what they're doing. what struck me the most was the variety of voices on this disc; you have the ethereal whisper of sufjan stevens sweet folk harmonies of the magic numbers the lazy drawl micah p. hinson. not only that but these are great interpretations from the jeff & tim cannon. very inspired and innovative - a beautiful accordion riff on 'grace' an irish-jig inflected 'no man can find the war'...these artists do not desire to replace jeff or tim they're merely reuniting us with what they left us - their music. ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative

 i hate saying this as a huge good charlotte fan but their new album is just a major waste of money. their first album is one of my top five albums of all time but this one sucks. the songs are all dance pop synthesized junk. no real guitars no messages to any of the songs no nothing. i dont know if joel is just too busy running around town with nicole richie or what but they skipped out on this album. the only redeaming song is the river on which they colaberated with m shadows and synester gates of avenged sevenfold. i hate hate hate to say it but dont waste your money or time on this one just listen to the first album and remember what a great band they used to be. ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 she doesn't sing... she yells!!! and using one of ednita's songs as she did with lo que son las cosas is just sacrilege at its best (or worst). it's really easy to hit it big with your first single when the song is already a classic by itself. she has absolutely nothing on beyonce or cristina aguilera. her cd is just plain bad! if you want to hear good music by latin women with beautiful powerful voices (and that actually sing) you might want to look for la lupe celia cruz ednita nazario and lucecita benitez... and these are only the ones i remembered at the moment ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 brooks & dunn kenny chesney lonestar martina mcbride montgomery gentry aaron tippin lee greenwood neal mccoy kenny rogers randy travis phil vassar the warren brothers dusty drake hank williams jr. alabama the charlie daniels band david ball and blackhawk. what do these artists have in common? cutting edge musical geniuses? gifted songwriters able to speak to a wide range of audiences? innovators in their genre? err no. actually what they all have in common is that they all appear on this package created to commercially exploit the war on terrorism one which contains songs like where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly this ain't no rag it's a flag and back where i come from. in other words maudlin xenophobic cliche filled black/white dichotomous sentiments and the lack of any attempt at rational or questioning political analysis all set to fiddles and pedal steel guitars and to be marketed and sold at wal-mart. i should add that i am not against patriotism when it is intelligent and well informed; this however is dumb reactionary faux-patriotism. nothing is more so than the song god bless the usa. as an american who loves his country i can say that this song with its syrupy sound and its naive lyrics does not speak for me. i listened to a bit of this schlock on a plane ride a while back just to see how much of it i could take. the answer was - not very much. what little i could take made me want to drink and heavily. some of these performers specifically brooks and dunn randy travis charlie daniels and perhaps kenny chesney and even (i hate to admit) toby keith are actually fairly talented; others like former lounge singer lee greenwood alabama montgomery gentry etc are 3rd rate musical hacks. ultimately listening to this nonsense i'm reminded that some of the greats of the genre like johnny cash hank williams george jones and willie nelson were neither knee-jerk reactionaries nor apologists for a ruling political party. then again dusty drake montgomery gentry and blackhawk are no johnny cashes. just nashville hacks soon to be forgotten. ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 okay take everything that you know about john squire. strip away the amazing stone roses first album the not so amazing follow up the nice brit pop of his work with the seahorses and picture this as a solo album from a new artist and i honestly think that peoples thoughts on this album would change drastically. they would realize that every track on it is a winner and that the guitar work is amazing and beautiful the vocals might be grating at first (think robert forster (the go-betweens) circa before hollywood) but that upon repeated listens grows on you and you eventually end up loving. what you expect going into an album has alot to do with how much you like or dislike it and this album is no exception. people should listen to it for what it is and not for what john squire was...john squire is an established song writer who has moved beyond what he used to do (who hasn't moved on in 13 years? minus robert smith of course!) and now writes beautiful pop songs...john squire has grown up just like his original audience has and this solo album is the perfect proof of that ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative
 joe cocker has one of the most distinctive gravelly voices in r & b history. he's always stuck to his roots and never gone with temporary fads or novelties. this collection is another classic with great covers from the beatles elton john and gary wright. his interpretive voice has always been the focal point of his songs but in dts 5.1 you are surrounded (as if in concert) by his presence. the completely adept and intuitive musicians that accompany him add more atmosphere without taking from his performance. imagine hearing him in live in a theater and you'll know what to expect from this warm and heartfelt album ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative

 when a young artist names her first two albums not &quot;judy&quot; or &quot;collins&quot; but &quot;a maid of constant sorrow&quot; and &quot;golden apples of the sun&quot;you know she takes herself seriously.originaly released in 1961. and 1962. their names were all i knew until i saw this cd recently.&quot;who will buy this?&quot; i wondered just to see the only copy snatched right in front of me.the comparisons with first two baez albums are inevitable (some songs were recorded by both) althought collins shows much more passion and involment where baez seemingly seduces herself with the beauty of her voice.on these early albums collins is frighteningly devoted keeper of the flame and her repertoire is almost exclusively traditional - which means not only ethereal beauty but also a certain (to some earsoverpowering) seriousnesscleverly mellowed by inclusion of joyous &quot;o daddy be gay&quot;a cousin to her &quot;grandfather&quot; recorded years later.althought i honestly love these songs and listen only this cd for daysthese early albums are today much more significant as seeds of collins later trademarks (voice will soar much higher in the futureshe slipped w.b.yeats into traditional folk collection just to later blossom into first-rate art-pop singer) and as they were product of their greenwich village timesthey may sound a bit dated to some modern ears.but they are still hauntingly beautiful to mei waited their re-release for too long ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative

 i've always written how the american now compilations do not even come close to the british ones and my opinion has not since changed. now 20's track list however is solid and pretty good for the american series. it has mostly good rap songs (which can be sometimes rare in this series) great rock songs and not an overload of mediocrities. i'll go in depth. 1. missy elliott feat. ciara & fatman scoop - lose control...a a great rap song - missy elliott has a great style and her lyrics are actually understandable and enjoyable. ciara is a nice addition to the song. fatman scoop's random screaming in the background wasn't essential but it at least adds some energy to the track. the music's actually interesting and something different from everything else. 2. black eyed peas - don't phunk with my heart...c+ their first album was stellar and their second is as well. but this was one of the worst tracks on monkey business and did not deserve to become a single. annoying but not horrible. 3. pussycat dolls feat. busta rhymes - don't cha...a- a really good rap song - busta's rapping is a good addition to the song making this radio remix better than the original on the pussycat dolls' album pcd. a dangerously catchy chorus elevates this song to a pretty high grade. 4. rihanna - pon de replay...b+ pretty catchy and a good party song. but it gets pretty irritating after a while. and the dip it low and you pick it up slow from the first verse directly copies from christina milian's dip it low. that's so unoriginal rihanna! 5. ludacris feat. bobby valentino - pimpin' all over the world...b good music but it's not much without the video which was by the way partly shot in africa. 6. bow wow feat. ciara - like you...b bow wow's returning to the rap scene was really unneeded but ciara's chorus makes this song better than mediocre. 7. dem franchize boys feat. jermaine dupri da brat & bow wow - i think they like me (remix)...c this song does not deserve the publicity and i'm stunned why people like this. it's worse than mediocre it's horribly irritating. and much of the song is bleeped out because the original is so dirty. rap just isn't rap when it's edited and this song is proof. but even without the editing i don't think this song has a chance. annoying yeps in the background and mediocre rapping...just skip it already. 8. destiny's child - cater 2u...b- mediocre for destiny's child. actually pretty boring. but they have great voices. 9. lyfe jennings - must be nice...c+ mediocre. 10. natasha bedingfield - these words...a a great new artist who actually found success with this song a year earlier the us. great songwriting about bad songwriting (if that makes any sense at all) and a good voice. now i'm just wondering when her brother daniel's going to release another if you're not the one. 11. kelly clarkson - behind these hazel eyes...a- the only american idol who earned over twenty minutes of success kelly's finding massive success with her second album and for a reason - she's got an awesome voice and pulls off rock quite well. this song was brutally murdered by the radio but that's why i've moved onto the remixes (not on this album). 12. d.h.t. - listen to your heart (unplugged version)...a though furios f.ez's hard trance remix of this song is a lot better than this unplugged piano version this amazing cover of the roxette track deserved all the fame it got. edmee's got a fantastic voice and this is a perfect song for her. beautiful song also. 13. backstreet boys - just want you to know...a- the backstreet boys' newest album must have been the #1 most unwanted comeback of all time (let's just hope n*sync doesn't follow...*cringe* justin timberlake) but this is their best song. and this comes from someone hard to impress by the backstreet boys but they pull off this rock song pretty well. 14. click 5 - just the girl...a a really good rock song which many can relate to. 15. franz ferdinand - do you want to...b atonal but franz ferdinand has a good reputation so i'll let it slide. but this is definitely evidence of a sophomore slump. 16. weezer - beverly hills...a+ unfortunately it was flattened torn apart and buried alive by the radios so i will review it as it was still last summer when i first heard it. this song is amazing and the chorus is way too catchy to believe. but i don't need to write this as most people already know. 17. fall out boy - sugar we're going down...a an amazing song but it's only good if you can put up with songs where you can't understand what they're saying. seriously it took approximately six times looking up the lyrics to actually realize what's being said here. but the music is great and this song overall is a pretty good rock track. 18. lifehouse - you & me...a- an instant classic. 19. coldplay - fix you...a+ i've read mixed reviews about this song but personally i think its amazing. following a vaguely similar buildup as led zeppelin's stairway to heaven this song just keeps you listening until the end. the rockout part at the end is magical. 20. keith urban - you'll think of me...b it's somewhat annoying that keith's been on now albums consistently for a while but his songs aren't as popular as say gretchen wilson. i'm starting to think keith's been put on these albums not for popular songs but just so a default country artist could be there. a good song but it could've been replaced with something better in the country department. so overall this is a great selection of songs some amazing some decent and some mediocre to bad. i'd suggest you buy this as it's a good list of tracks. overall this album gets a b+. ,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive

 for hard-driving well-crafted rock-and-roll from the late 70s/early 80s you can't do much better than pat benatar (and heart) and this collection carries most -- but not all -- of the singles that dominated the airwaves for 4 years: heart breaker hit me with your best shot love is a battlefield fire and ice promises in the dark. but no benatar collection is complete without 'treat me right' 'you better run' and 'i want a lover who won't drive me crazy' (superior in my opinion to the john mellencamp version) especially if you prefer benatar's hard-driving rockers to her slower ballads. nevertheless 'best shots' is a great place to start and certainly - at $10-15 versus $50 for the more complete 'all fired up' -- the best value for the money. ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive
 ...and if you're fortunate enough to find it i recommend buying the version with the bonus dvd which chronicles the making of yellow brick road. when i bought it it cost the same as the 2 sacd set without the dvd so it was still a great deal. my only complaint--and it's really minor--is that it would have been nice if they could have fit the original album onto a single sacd. a second disc could have included the bonus tracks that are included in this package plus any extra--maybe even audio-only interviews--still remaining in the vaults. no matter. the important thing if you are able is to make sure you have an sacd-compatible player (like the pioneer dv-563a or one of the really expensive players if you've got the cash and love audiophile formats in both your hardware and your cds). even if you don't the stereo cd layer still sounds truly excellent ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 that this great music sounds so awful on this cd. i wanted an introduction to kate bush's music and this cd seemed a very good way to start. when i put it on i couldn't believe how muffled and dull it sounded. i could swear i'm listening to the music through a wall of cotton. i went to the existing reviews here on amazon and sure enough ferrara brain pan's spot-on review stated exactly what i was feeling upon listening to these recordings. it is inexcusable that an artist of bush's stature is represented in such poor technical fashion - and a shame considering how good the songs are. another little beef is that the cd clocks in at under 49 minutes - in other words there's room for 30 more minutes of music which i'm certain could have been well-used considering the vastness of her catalogue. i will be looking for the remastered individual albums but if i didn't know how good kate bush was outside of the context provided by this butchered collection i wouldn't bother buying any more of her material. shame on emi for allowing this. i give it two stars (instead of one) simply because the music is so very good ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative
 this album has new meaning to me now in 2007 where i go to a college next to a high school where i see a bunch of punk rockers spending lots of money to make sure their hair is pretty and that their clothes are properly tattered to maximize trendiness. there are plenty of punk rock bands out there that keep the spirit of social distortion alive but sometimes their music is hard to find and all the posers you see start to slowly extinguish that old punk rock fire. albums like this exist for times like those. just stick it in turn up the volume and rock out ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive

 nobody captures the spirit and essence of a city at night like new york city's own ultrablue. the group is the brainchild of keyboardist/producer john smatla and jazz guitarist dave stryker who bring in an nyc all-star cast of players in addition to their impressive band ensemble to create a sophisticated and evocative musical mood. ultrablue is the latest outing for ultrablue and the first release on 215 records. the project drips of chill smooth jazz and rich rhythmic textures that will keep the project in replay mode for a good while in your car and home players and on your ipod. special guests include singer/saxophonist pete belasco trumpet/flugelhorn player randy brecker female vocal group allure flutist nestor torres and brazilian vocalist gabriella anders. from the sexy saunter guilty pleasures and the spicy and sultry indiscretions to the scintillating soul candy ultrablue provides such a cool groove and flow that it really does lend itself to be the perfect soundtrack to a night out or in (for that matter). pete belasco is featured on the sensual cover the summer knows while nestor torres livens things up on the groove jungle fever and the delicious gabriela anders delivers an alluring vocal on destiny. the project's first single shiver is already attracting radio airplay from coast to coast... we expect big things from ultrablue on this and all of their future releases. this is the new standard of smooth jazz. ~sandy shor ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 if you enjoyed explosions in the sky's last album the earth is not a cold dead place and the songs by the group on the friday night lights soundtrack then surely you shall find love for their newest record all of a sudden i miss everyone. if you are new to explosions in the sky i can only personally describe their music to you as lush captivating graceful energetic and highly inspirational art rock instrumentations. please ignore reviewers who rate this album negatively because they don't like it as much as their last album(yet). all of a sudden i miss everyone is different than previous records; it is alot darker but at the same time hopeful and promising best listened to on a rainy day or a cold dark night(again personal description). what more can i say... this is about as beautiful as three guitars and a drum set can sound. my favorite album of 2007 so far. ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

 the essential jimmie rodgers is highly recommended for any serious country music fan. if anyone is the genuine article it is jimmie. listeners will recognize some old favorites among the tracks including frankie and johnny mule skinner blues and t for texas. there are also fine versions of waitin' for a train and in the jailhouse now though some may prefer jerry lee lewis' version of the former and the webb pierce recording of the latter. the most interesting tracks are less well known. these include my old pal my old sunny south by the sea and one devoted not to a mother but a father (!)-daddy and home. for this reviewer the album hit its high point on the final track a mournful tb blues a reference to the disease that took jimmie's life at 35. while jimmie's yodeling style may not be for everyone this reviewer considers this album a safe bet. keep in mind that jr was elected to both the country and rock and roll hall of fame. further the essential series of albums rarely disappoints. these almost always sponsor well- produced compilations of our past heroes best efforts. the essential jimmie rodgers certainly falls into that category ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
 bob james - the mastermind of smooth jazz. h touchdown grand piano cannyon. eternal pieces of art. brave and thoughtful new directions in jazz. we owe him a lot. but the recent releases of fourplay -including x - don't meet my expectations at all: predictable repetitive overproduced computer-music. the typical fourplay sound squeezed out like a lemon in another cd. larrys guitar playing takes a nice direction on tournabout - but then the song falls back again to old routine. screenplay is a good one (one of two songs that were done by bob). the rest hmm... some nice solos constricted in predictabiltiy. don't get me wrong i like all of the guys. every single member of the group has done great things in the past. so - a bit more breveness yes please ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 ok - let me preface my comments by justifying the 2-star rating...it's rodney dangerfield - he was a class act. as for the cd: if you're looking for a few songs by a comedian accompanied by someone's cheesy clavinova then this cd is for you. i bought this because of the last track rappin' rodney and boy was i disappointed. it sounds like it was recorded from an old worn out cassette. do yourself a favor - get all of rodney's dvd's with his standup material and remember him for what he was - a comedy legend ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative
 ice cube is back for his 6th solo with the peace disc. this may be my favorite album from cube (close with lethal injection). his lyrics are much different then his first few albums and the beats changed with tthe times but it's still nice to hear from cube. with 13 songs none ar ebad 5 are ok 1 is almost a classic and the rest are good. guests are on 4 songs so you still get enough cube to satisfy you. production is decent as well chuckey thompson & one eye each do 3 songs puff daddy younglord bud'da battlecat dr. dre t-bone and charley bear all do 1 song. a must have album for fans of ice cube. #1 - 8.5 (f/ mc ren & dr. dre -- n.w.a. reunion) #3 - 8.5 #4 - 8.5 (f/ jayo felony gangsta from the comrads and squeek ru) #5 - 7.5 (1 minute intro before he raps) #7 - 8.5 (nice beat) #8 - 9.5 (f/ krayzie bone -- nice beat) #9 - 7.5 (f/ mack 10 & ms. toi -- also on the next friday soundtrack) #11 - 8.5 (nice beat) #12 - 7 #13 - 7 #15 - 7.5 #16 - 8 (good beat) #17 - 8 o'shea jackson -- b. 6/15/69 check all my review ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 this record is a fine example of earnest juju music. other artits have tricked it up some with synths and keyboards. chief commander obe has always managed to offer more traditional representation of juju as it evolved from highlife. keep in mind this means amazing percussion work intertwining guitar lines loving vocals and long well developed instrumentals. if you're interested you should buy it. it will make you happy no matter how you were feeling and what you're doing ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 i can understand that robin felt a need to include some of the biggest bee gees hits to appease the fans but the ones that were sung by barry are below wretched here. robin frequently disappears in the sound mix becoming little more than one of a group singing harmony. that's fine for a group concert like the bee gees but inexcusable for a solo effort. his stiff between song talk sounds like a bad lounge act. they should have kept this in the can. it seems like it is meant as little more than a money grab for robin. don't do him the favor ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 this guy is going to become big someday. i agree with this reviewer: the songs on seven swans with a folksy bucholic feeling that runs through most of them tell of spiritual tales. they tell of love that transcends the body and age. sufjan can appeal equally to the christian person as to the one who practices zen buddhism. and that is something few songwriters can accomplish. keep an eye on sufjan for years to come. i have fun tooling around with to be alone with you on the guitar such a simple but infectious melody. seven swans is not over orchestrated like michigan and illinois seem to be. good song to ok song ratio is about 85 percent on this one and about 45-50 percent on the the aforementioned cd's. seven swans is a great way to get introduced to the subtle musical power and overall genius of sufjan. sufjan has all his own style and is not afraid to tell us who he is. very creative...he truly forges his own musical path. cannot wait for his cd called wisconsin. ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative

 unless you frequented jazz clubs in baltimore or philly in the fall of 1955 this would have been your first exposure to the miles davis-john coltrane collaboration (a few tracks recorded for columbia the label miles would soon be joining exclusively a few weeks before this session weren't issued until much later). davis settled on coltrane as his replacement for the departing sonny rollins almost by default - no one else fit the bill or new the book. that they would stay together long seemed unlikely because their temperaments differed so much (davis was a hands-off leader coltrane wanted constant input from miles on his playing and music in general). stablemates (a benny golson tune) is the track that seems to draw the most attention. it's an excellent composition and although coltrane sounds somewhat tentative (nervous?) the performance is attractive. but my favorite side is there is no greater love even though coltrane sits this one out: miles plays beautifully and i love the emotion he wrings from the tune. true this is an early effort by the group that would transform modern jazz but it's a very good session nonetheless. the group plays well the rhythm section is rock solid and they are all off and running. full speed ahead ,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
 superior to the first steppenwolf album in many ways and including a song that tops even 'born to be wild' itself 'magic carpet ride' is as essential as the group's first album even to the casual rock fan. it opens with 'faster than the speed of life' a perfect blend of steppenwolfish hard rock & airplanesque psychedelic rock (like 'she has funny cars'). 'tighten up your wing' is an upbeat bluesy track that bounces well along before being replaced with 'none of your doing' a steppenwolf-classic that shifts gear between verse & chorus. 'spiritual fantasy' is one of the strangest creations on the album strangely touching though appaling at first. but given a second chance it comes across as one of the best tracks on the album. the marihuana-anthem 'don't step on the grass sam' is pure heavy steppenwolf a timeless classic that crunches slowly but steadily along. '28' is a great rock song with just a hint of psychedelia in the melody. a neat little rocker that is followed by the ultimate psychedelic dance track. 'magic carpet ride' is simply steppenwolf's best song ever a fantastic blend of rhytm melody & vision that is worth the price of all steppenwolf's classic albums on its own. it was also the only of their singles to almost replicate 'born to be wild's us #2 placing when it shot to #3 on the us chart. 'disappointment number' is almost that but then not again. it is an odd ode to/parody of old blues complete with bird sounds in the background as if it's an old blues singer sitting out in the open. 'lost and found by trial and error' has a great tune and rocks away well as does 'hodge podge strained through a leslie' and 'resurrection'. both employ the classic steppenwolf sound in a great rocking way to become if not classics then at least steppenwolf-standards. the album closes with 'reflections' a weird song that seems like somebody trying to be visionary before you realize that that is just what he is. just in a very peculiar way. the album has some if not weak then not too powerful spots but generally it is a more than worthy follow-up to the first steppenwolf album with a great blend of the band's traditional hard rock and a form of psychedelia that suits them perfectly. even the least interesting tracks rock nicely & no-one should have anything to complain about here.. ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

 i do not see how reviewers can rate this guy 5 stars. his voice is so mediocre that i am suprised he manages to sell many cd's at all. i wouldn't waste my hard earned cash on this guy. stick with sinatra and get the best. if not and you want someone who can sing sinatra style then i would recommend you listen to the young canadian michael buble. in my opinion michael buble is a much better singer that tyrell. he can swing and do justice to that genre of music ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 what can be said about this album? this is one of those albums that re-invigorates your faith/enthusiasm in music (those who listen to a lot of albums know what i mean). some tracks from here were most famously covered by nirvana on their unplugged album although pained i don't think cobain quite got the feel that kirkwood gives to these songs. it has a perfect blend of songs that make you want to almost hoe-down and those that you can just reflect on and chill out. particular stand outs on this album are split myself in two magic toy missing aurora borealis and the whistling song. this album does take some growing as kirkwood's voice is abrasive but this is an album that will truly make you love music. do try it you won't be disappointed. ,positive,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 this soundtrack was `heart-brokenly' disappointing to me mainly because it lacks a few songs that were in the film. i bought this soundtrack for one specific song (and it would've been worth every penny if only it was included): the song near the end when alexander marches through the desert to return home to babylon after his recovery. such a disappointment that wasn't included. in the other hand i'm satisfied with some of the tracks that were included. i particularly liked roxane's veil even though i don't recall hearing it in the film. ,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative
 this cd has some good songs on it but the majority of them are less than 2 minutes! it's kind of a rip off since the songs are much shorter than i expected. they are mixed together and sometimes a song is so short that the one before it is still fading out by the time the song after it has started! if you don't mind really short songs buy this but i wouldn't recommend it otherwise ,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative
 first of all bob dylan is certainly not for everyone. however if his style is up your alley this is a classic. you can turn on the radio and hear all those classic songs of his like lay lady lay or like a rolling stone to name a couple. planet waves is the type of album where the sum of the songs come together wonderfully. this is probably my favorite dylan album and i have all the classics like blonde on blonde blood on the tracks highway 61 revisited. ect. i'd recommend this to any dylan fan ,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative

 to set the record straight rodney 'darkchild' jerkins produced one song on this album and that is 'he said'. that said producer waryn 'baby dubb' campbell [also husband of erika younger of the duo] did a great job on this album. not at all to say that the ladies' singing hasn't always been phenomenal. the highlights of this album include the aforementioned darkchild song a guest apperance by fred hammond on 'this love' [their appearance on his album speak those things' is duly noted] an impressively done cover of stevie wonder's 'you will know' and a cover of walter hawkins' 'thank you'. yes that is the original sampled at the end of the song. every album that mary mary has released to this day [yes all two of them] has proven that gospel music can be musically current-- impressive-- and still within taste. that's what happens when you have the best on your team... baby dubb while being mary mary's resident producer can also be found on kierra sheard's 'let go' 'sweetest thing' 'all i am' fred hammond's albums 'speak those things' and 'somethin' 'bout love' and countless other records. the downside: the last two songs. they're of forgettable quality. while happy forgettable. overall this album is an essential ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative

 don't waste your money. this album is cheesy sounds like a million other pop rock songs and is nothing compared to their earlier work. with donnie van zant and max carl on vocals all i have to say is: they need the old lead singer back! the guitar work is ok but the classic .38 special sound has definitely been lost ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive

 the previous review has a few inaccuracies i thought i'd correct. first off the beats on all of atmosphere's albums including this one are produced and created by ant not dj abilities. ant does not perform live and so slug often used to perform with dj abilities (and others). this may change in the next album as atmosphere now includes a band soon to tour but it's extermely likely ant will be included in the production. slug has never been 1/3 of atmosphere he has and always will be the main driving force and only consistent member of the group. even when spawn was a member of atmosphere slug was still clearly the leader and brains beyond the operation as evidenced by the tracks on overcast! all of which were dominated by slug. yes this album is quite different from the newer stuff and represents a critical moment in atmosphere's evolution. of course anyone can listen to it. even those silly fan boys. it's a ridiculous notion to suggest that because something has changed people won't like earlier incantations of the same group. it's that elitist old school b.s. and it's annoying. some may not like it but most hip-hop fans will probably enjoy it. what makes this album so interesting is how raw it is and as slug says in the liner notes how it's representative of his transformation as an mc. recorded between overcast! and lucy ford you can witness slug move from being a whitty well-versed thug to something deeper and more innovative. both elements are present. the abusing of the rib is one of the more evolved tracks on the album while @ it again is about sleeping with all sorts of girls in the twin cities including yours of course. note that i say evolved not in the sense that one song is better than another but rather more representative of slug's later work (lucy ford). this album represents a critical moment in the history of what i believe is the best hip hop group (individual) out there. while it doesn't have the catchiest melodies (the beats are great just not catchy) it has some amazing rhymes and showcases slug's ability to flow quickly and rap prolifically. check it out ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative
 after reading glowing reviews of the dbts i picked up three of their cds. while some of the lyrics are strong the songs have no melodies whatsoever. most of the arrangements consist of guitars blaring over a terrible singer. they're reputed to be carrying on the tradition of skynyrd and the allmans. but those bands weren't just loud guitars...they had memorable tunes and great singers. dbts are a huge letdown ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 the best of taste compiles material from their 4 official albums released from 1969-72. the albums consisted of two studio albums &quot;taste&quot; &quot;on the boards and the two live albums &quot;live taste&quot; and &quot;live at the isle of wight&quot;. this band was a power trio led by rory gallagher before he disbanded the group to embark on a successful solo career. the band led by gallagher on vocals guitar (electric acoustic &amp; slide) harmonica and alto sax specialized in hard hitting blues rock. the music has much in common with cream. however the richard mccracken and john wilson could not compete with the stellar musicianship of jack bruce and ginger baker. the undervalued gallagher is an unsung guitar hero whose work compares favorably with that of eric clapton. like cream the band favored extended versions of tunes like &quot;sugar mama&quot; and &quot;i feel good&quot; included here. the music included here is varied. it ranges from the slow gut wrenching version of &quot;catfish&quot; to the more acoustic cover of &quot;leavin' blues&quot;. the cuts from &quot;on the boards&quot; become more jazzy at times. tracks like &quot;on the boards&quot; and &quot;it's happenened before it'll happen again&quot; highlight the band's more improvisational approach. hard hitting tracks like &quot;eat my words&quot; spotlight gallagher's outstanding slide technique. two cuts i miss from this period which are not included here are &quot;dual carriageway pain&quot; from &quot;taste and &quot;morning sun&quot; from &quot;on the boards&quot;. the live concert favorite &quot;sinner boy&quot; provides a bridge to gallagher's solo career as the studio version was included on his first solo album &quot;rory gallagher&quot;. this anthology provides a great overview of the early work of irish blues-rock guitar hero rory gallagher and his battered stratocaster. it is even more essential as the four original albums are only available as imports ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
 there's always the argument that if bach had had a modern piano he would have composed for it. let's consider another possibility: if some style-insensitive time machine had delivered a piano to bach's doorstep he might have tried it out and rejected it as a bad idea since it so obviously fails to serve the paramount musical ideals that inspired the high baroque composers. for listeners who understand what bach meant by equal temperament it's worth noting that the standard temperament of the modern piano bears no close connection to what bach was trying to demonstrate in these pedagogical compositions. in other words the point is lost. ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 if you do not yet own dark side of the moon wish you were here and the wall do not even consider purchasing a momentary lapse of reason. amlor is junk by comparison. that said very few rock albums ever made can hang with those three and amlor certainly has its bright spots. learning to fly and on the turning away are as good as anything pink floyd has ever produced. some of the other songs are adequate but this album does not contain the front-to-back brillance of the earlier floyd releases. it's definitely worth having but make sure that you have the others first. ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
 my 8-month-old son and i listen to this cd every night and by the pachelbel canon (track 7) he's usually sound asleep. it is not all synthesizer. the jacket clearly states that the music box orchestra includes flute piano cello percussion english horn and oboe. as a musician i am not offended by the easy-listening versions of these classics. in fact i enjoy them. they introduce my son to the timeless melodies without overstimulating him at bedtime. i find them relaxing too ,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative

 i received this 2cd set in the mail and was horrified at the sound quality of the so called mastering. i have original un-mastered copies of some reo speedwagon albums that sound better than this set! i love reo to death and the track listing is good to go but in all honesty this compilation falls flat on its face in regards to sound quality. the band seriously needs to find a good remasterer and give the fans what they have been waiting for. i cannot recommend any previous greatest hits releases that even come close. save your money and wait ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 i do not understand why people are so waxing poetic about this album. there is nothing new or 'fresh' or 'original' or at all thought-brovoking about this music unless you happen to be easily pleased by any simple pseudo-pop sound. i have only recently discovered the world of no-wave music but i was introduced to it through artists like arab on radar and scissor girls. so when i tried out my first sonic youth album i was way more than dissapointed. i don't know how this can be classified as no-wave anymore. sure they show some trait in a few wailing off key guitars and an occasioinal shouted spoken word but they are all only half-assed and are muddled up in cliche indie pop love tunes that have only been done in every other band. the most notable anything is the catchy medlody of becuz. it is really catchy yet it managaes to be unique enough to rise above the typical catchy tunes ethos. xiu xiu's knife play would probably be considered more of a pop/no-wave sound that does not sacrifice the aggressive anti-music drive of no-wave... and still retain the emotional pop sinsibility. i don't know.. all i know is that wasing machine is a letdown. it does not reach me artistically by a long shot. emotionally i can think of am million other artists (mars volta emerson lake & palmer clouddead ulver edvard greig!) who can put me on a much higher cloud and help me get in touch with the human condition. this however is far to cheezy and i don't know but i think it reeks of that shallow indie fashion clique.. ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 perhaps puffy only got as far as he could riding on biggie's legacy but lets face it he really has very little talent charisma charm and just seems so dull he is basically a male paris hilton going around acting like the world's biggest d1ck ny saying look people i got money arent i cool besides biggie(rip) bad boy really is not great most of the artists are poor quality the production is awful and no one has not even shown potetial. this album is basically not even worth printing or existing. it is just sad that many great underground rappers are not getting any attention while garbage like diddy plague are airwaves and puts his dumb face everywhere on tv. i don't know why people like tupac biggie dimebag chuck shuldiner and countless other greats are buried but this guy still breaths. so i would say in conclusion that we should do what people like chingy and d4l deserve a 1 star rating. ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 and he's a super-talented drummer. the day the foos release a best-of compilation i'll probably pick it up. otherwise i'm sad to say that the average foo fighters album cut just doesn't cut it for me. all of the songs on there is nothing left to lose are mediocre run-of-the mill alternative rock. only stacked actors has some real songwriting substance and it does have some swagger and bite but to be perfectly honest it still isn't a huge turn-on in my book. learn to fly the other track that got some airplay on alt-rock radio may as well have been written by the outfield or some other average rock band along those lines. i almost gave this album two stars but unfortunately i think that rating would be just too generous. foo fighters have made some really good songs like everlong. but i honestly don't think they'd be nearly as big if grohl hadn't drummed for one of the most highly revered and charismatic bands of all time nirvana. elsewhere their fantastic cover versions such as gary numan's down in the park and prince's darling nikki suggest they are great rockers but less great in the songwriting department ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive
 i've been a jim brickman fan for a few years now. when i saw this cd came out i could not resist getting it. it is absolutely amazing and fully worth it. when i first put it in my stereo i had to sit there just to listen to the first few tracks without doing anything. that was how impressive they were. the title of the album is incredibly fitting. while my roommate is venting about the latest drama in her group of friends i have this cd turned up in my own little corner to escape from it all. i swear i could not have found anything more fitting to be listening to while trying to get away from real life for a bit. if you love jim brickman or just like soft jazz or piano music this cd is a must have ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative

 all in all i was really dissapointed; i really enjoyed the king geedorah album. i thought the king geedorah album boasted stellar thematic production tolerable skits and street-wise but deep lyrical content. doom is on the boards for about 1/3 of the tracks on 'escape...' all have the stereotypical doom sound with the only standout being '12...12.' the x-ray produced tracks are minimal but generally sound stiff lacking much of a groove - thin synth lines few sampled melodies. i did like 'warning (kong)' which has a nice minimal dark groove. the lyrical flows have a classic new york sound pretty good. lyrical content is pretty bad unless you enjoy repetitious rhymes about smoking weed and women riding my d$&*. ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 jeff beck is far from the typical rock guitarist. he never took the easy path of showing how fast or virtuoso he is. instead he is full of intriguing and explosive ideas that make you want to listen to this cd over and over again. that's what musicianship is all about and jeff has plenty of it ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive

 1978 the stage is set for an album to emerge out of the crumbling decay that is the city of cleveland. just like their other fellow ohion's devo the guys in pere ubu obviously saw the world in a slightly different way.i have owned this recording in various formats since 1980 and i have never grown tired of this album. i find this album to have an almost timless quality in that even though it was recorded over 25 years ago if the original band itself tried to go back into the studio and re-record it it just would'nt happen. there is just a certain magic that they captured in 1978 as to the music itself i tend to break - up this album into 2 distinct parts. side one being the more accessible drunken side with more garage style sounds almost punk rock in its leanings guitar wise but a little too intelligent just listen to the lyrics.side 2 is definately the drug side like a bad acid trip vocalist david thomas takes you on a journey thru the seedy back streets of cleveland(i have never heard smashing bottles sound so creepy or atmospheric) and the rest of the band help to re-inforce this craziness by going off in a million different directions.i could give you a track by track anylisis of this record but suffice to say that music is somethig you should anylize experience and consume at your own leisure and then form your own opion of what each of the songs on this album mean to you. so if you loved things like throbbing gristle's song hamburger lady then u will surely love pere ubu's album the mordern dance.as another reviewer mentioned before black francis of the pixies fame must have almost certainly listened to these guys.i also hear there influences in recent bands such as portishead and queens of the stone age just to name a few.so if you enjoy bold experimental music that is still as fresh sounding as it was in 1978 then give your ears a chance to have a listen to this album even if you have to begsteal or borrow it. ,positive,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive
 i wonder if the two reviewers who said they were disappointed in this soundtrack watched the film? my guess is that they did not. the film was enhanced by the james horner score and it would have been hurt by anything that was not light and subtle. it is a unique and amazing film and the score is a perfect match. by the way the bigwigs at universal nearly died when they heard it and then were equally stunned when they asked horner for the written score and he had to admit that none existed! wonderful music ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative
 the songs are boring the lyrics are plain. i am so dissapointed. i bought it without listening to it first thinking i would at least find one song. how wrong was i to find out that not even one track speaks to me. andrea's solo album sucked. now this! i think their creative days are over and if i see them in concert again i hope i am not tortured with the music from this new album. instead i hope they play the oldies but goodies that characterize them as the band i love so muc ,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative
 we read all the previous reviews and thought this disc would be a keeper. we (my husband three kids 14 10 and 5) tried it on a warm spring evening in the car. one or two songs like the banana splits speed racer and scooby-doo were fun. most however were harsh and too fast for the parents and youngest guy. i would rather try these songs in their original state and skip the covers ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 i found a supposedly new remastered edition of sade's diamond life on sale for less than 10 bucks. oops! great mistake! when i tried to return it the cd store was already out of business and the copy is one issued in the netherlands which is marked into the booklet as 2000 digital remastered version. the whole album has been re-recorded with new arrangements! the digital sound is quite good but the new arrangements made for 'smooth operator' really sucks!! ,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 i have been a ronstadt fan since the early 70's and although the nelson riddle stage and the mexican stage were not my style i still loved her vocal perfection. this is truly the only album i haven't played more than twice (i didn't like it the first time which surprised me so i tried it again). it doesn't showcase her voice or her talents. the songs are very ho hum. linda put out a christmas album (been waiting for years) and try to get sweetness back for this old fan ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative
 guys...it's not that good. i have the album on my computer and i gave it a few listens but...it has no substance. it's not interesting or anything new. it's catchy. and irritating after more than a song or two. that's all (bandages is enjoyable once in a while i will concede). if you're looking for catchy and poppy (and there's nothing wrong with that) then buy it. if you want something new and original - don't. and if you want good indie dance/electronica-type music go for something like the faint the bravery or le tigre. ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative
 i won't say to everybody this greatest hits is highly recommended. being that i never heard all of her albums so a true fan may feel like some songs is missin'. however for me who is just really startin to seriously get into pop is somewhat satisfied with these and this is a 5 star collection to me. some of the tracks i love a couple i don't like at all and the rest i just like. my favorite ones are in order; erotica ray of light beautiful stranger the power of goodbye deeper and deeper the prodution is excellent and i love the vocals. if your new to madonna my opinion would be to start here. but a true fan can give me lessons. ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative
 i don't like this album as much as their earlier stuff. i have liked each release less than the previous and this one falls right in line with that trend. the opener &quot;quality revenge . . .&quot; is one of their best songs hands down though. this is a very good cd but the farther from braid we get in time the less i seem to like their music ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative

 is there anything more sanctimonious than filming your last concert and inviting a bunch of fellow overrated hacks (clapton neil diamond joni mitchell) to the occasion as if it's some monumental event? please! as if the band were anything worthwhile in the first place. sorry but the whole concept of a bunch of canadians (well four of five anyway) writing this stuff about americana always came across to me as pretentious -- and it doesn't get much worse than that stupid shot of levon helm wheezing through the night they drove old dixie down. these guys were just the beneficiaries of rolling stone/elitist rock critic propaganda. (and to think they made fun of prog bands for writing inane lyrics -- huh!) i think martin newell put it best when he called the band dreadful bearded ghastliness. ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive
 boo-wop? haha ok anyways i bought his through middle-piller distro. and it's got a couple of o.k. songs on it. the problem is the singing and the overall production. this is definetely a home-recording on computer deal. the vocals are waaaaay weak. what exactly is a re-worked debut album??? i thought once an album was out it was done set in stone? apparently notso mister monster gets to pull a blitzkid (who changed their first album cover years after it came out!) and take the cheezy way out. a definete step up from bands like blitzkidbut still in the cellar of rock n roll. do yourself a favor and buy some good old deathrock from the golden years ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative,positive

 yes yes we all know the mega hit when i see you smile. but it would be unfair to put this album into the one hit wonder basket and instead review it as a whole. the band hits gear pretty early with best of what i got but after that it's pretty bad. how possession ever became a hit i've not idea. well where i come from it didn't but in the us this mob had a string of soppy power ballad hits. the production is good but the fire goes out for most of the album. neil schon is a great guitarist but it was the late 80's and the guy obviously knew what he had to do for a decent paycheck. besides he probably wanted some revenge on steve perry so he really wanted to make some cash. pity listen to some of the guitar licks here and there is a decent hard rock album in the man. rockin' horse for example. an interesting additin to the aor landscape and some of the music is lively. but when the whole thing has as much heft as a lettuce leaf it just doesn't get my vote. even my devoted aor fan girlfriend of the time only liked the one track (we all know which one). but hey if aor is your bag you could do a lot worse ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive
 vote this one off the island: 19 overproduced prog-tropical instrumentals consisting entirely of primitive thumping chanting and grunting - sort of a new age tribal orgy with pygmy porn music composed by phil collins. it's all supposed to convey the drama intrigue and relevance of a tv show (survivor yell mud bath chase race tally the vote i can see it buzzed) with no drama intrigue and relevance. a desperate last ditch dig for one of the most unimportant moments in television ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 this truly is a masterpiece of pop music. there is not a wasted moment. the songs all blend together majestically one after the other. you really must listen from beginning to end to get the full effect. i agree with the reviewer that stated that 'don't look back' is one of the best songs i have ever heard. i told a colleague that my heart melts when it plays. i don't mean to be gushing but this album stands apart. i had to put it away for awhile because it is somewhat addictive. ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative

 tom delonge is at it again with a new band and a new album. even with being accompanied by the lead guitarist from boxcar racer angels and airwaves managed to have a completely different sound. they dropped the more punk rock tone of boxcar racer in favor of an emo-alternative style of rock. the first released single the adventure is quite enjoyable and even though i haven't checked too deeply into it i think it's the theme song for nbc's studio 60. besides how can you go wrong with an album that's gone double platinum in the uk and gold in canada ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive
 i supposed i should not have been watching this movie when i was nine years old but i remember seeing it several times via hbo. more importantly my father bought the soundtrack and we used to listen to it over & over in the car. the songs stuck with me for years and every know and then i'll hear something out of context and i'll be taken back to roadtrips with my family. it's something that i won't think about for ages but when i'm reminded of it i can't believe i don't still have a copy of the soundtrack. i remember it had quiet and comforting songs mixed in with songs you could sing along too. it's perfect for driving and just having on in the background ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 here's a line from the song vato on this album: i wouldn't be the n_____ that i am if i didn't pop n____z in the mouth. isn't that poetic? snoop dogg manages to pull off an amazing feat. he makes sex drugs and violence seem so ... boring. i feel like i am supposed to be offended. but it's too boring to be offensive. we have songs about every kind of gang violence every kind of drug and every kind of cheap sex. and what are we left with? he gets two stars because his approach to the city of los angeles is fresh and loving. hip hop should be local and he does a good job with that. otherwise it'd be a one-star ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 the guitars aren't loud enough and neither is the bass for that matter which is so true but it's still a great album. seeing them live makes up for this cd no doubt. stand out songs: -the city sleeps in flames -the world as we know it -just a taste -my darkest hour -empty glasses -the only medicine 'my darkest hour' & 'empty glasses' are my favorites. i know those songs by heart ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative

 i rarely write reviews of music but feel that i must share my impressions of this cd. i have long heard some of my favorite singers praise the songwriting prowess of townes but somehow never got around to buying one of his records. i finally picked this one up because it had two songs that were covered by two of my favorite singers--lyle lovett-lungs (among others) and steve earle-tecumseh valley. i was blown away by the sheer beauty and poetry of every song on this recording. other reviewers seem to be comparing this to other townes' records. i come from a different angle. as someone who has long heard townes sopken of with the highest praise i can say this disk does not disappoint and will influence me to fill out my collection of his recordings. i will also say that i am deeply frustrated that i never took advantage of the chance to see townes perform while he was alive. ,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative
 a lot of music fans have mused over why matthew sweet did not achieve greater success with the masses despite his obvious ability to write very catchy songs. sick of myself single-handedly rejuvenated my faith in the power of pop music at a time when pop seemed to have exhausted its possibilities. but in retrospect sweet simply wasn't a very marketable commodity for the music industry and on top of that his vocals and lyrics somehow didn't grab people. its not that he doesn't sing with passion or feeling but somehow the words seem to get lost in the mix. perhaps its a production thing; regardless the vocals on a ms album always seem to be secondary to the music and that is a no-no for any great singer-songwriter. there are some truly impressive (albeit derivative) stuff here: what matters is in my opinion the greatest byrds song never written hide is a beautiful piano ballad that wouldn't seem out of place on badfinger compilation if time permits has some of the most beautiful chorus harmonies not written by brian wilson etc. etc. i've been waiting works well in combining catchy melody with plaintive adolescent desire and girlfriend is for the most part a great rocker. however after the relatively simple production of girlfriend his later albums got bogged down in an attempt to recreate a wall of sound feeling which quite frankly doesn't really work unless you're phil spector. not much here can be completely discounted and the new songs fit in quite well (although i probably would have included evangeline at the expense of ready). despite the undeniable quality of the music there is nothing life-changing here and ultimately great music must at least have the semblance of being life-changing. still heartily recommended for fans of catchy melodic pop-rock ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive

 as a lover of gospel bluegrass i anticipated an enjoyable listening session with blue highway's latest offering. let me first say that i am a fan of this group which i consider to be one of the premier groups in bluegrassdom but what i heard was bluegrass muzak. yes the group's tight harmonies and excellent musicianship were in evidence and that is what saved this disc from being sold to the local reseller but the lack of inspiration and excitement was disappointing. gospel music even bluegrass gospel has a tendency to preachiness and taking itself too seriously as this disc proves. a good gospel recording must have some cuts which are humorous some serious and contemplative some that push the envelope of orthodoxy and most importantly it must have an element of fun in order to keep the attention of the listeners. this disc fails in that regard containing standard old gospel chestnuts along with some original songs that ape the oldtime standards. my advice is to either borrow it from a friend before buying new or buy used. want mine ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative
 while there are some flashes of brilliance in this album it is compromised by a lack of direction. the 'tastes so sweet' mix of rapture is beautiful although cut far too short. faithless afrika bambaataa &amp; soulsonic and crystal method are all good driving tracks at the tail end of this album. the high point without contest is darude's ripping mix of rising star's 'touch me'. this is a cut to throw on for the peak... when you find the party is just outside of barstow with hunter. that said then there are all the uninspired tracks in the center of the album. these are more appropriate in an adolescent brit girl's drawer next to the spice girls. for some labels this would be normal for ministry however it is a dissapointment ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 my dj side: i actually had to stop the music open the tray on the cd player then check whether i had the right cd1 down-tempo in or some other cd that my wife played before as the music was so not what i was expecting sounding more like deep forest than jvm. to my surprise it was jimmy's balance 10. i decided to keep an open mind and listen to it anyway. i went to sleep after the 4th track. the next day i decided to listen to the second cd (mid tempo). again i stopped the music opened the tray on the cd player then checked whether i had the (mid tempo cd) in instead of the down-tempo i was playing the night before. sure enough the (mid tempo) was what i had in the player but did not sound much different than the lullabies i was listening to on cd1. when the mid-tempo was over i thought to myself well this would be very nice for an upcoming relaxing dinner with friends. the next day i had high hopes for the up tempo cd cause well as the name implies it should be where the beats and treats are. but no. not really. the only reason i didn't freak out from listening to the 1st and 2nd cd of jimmy van m's balance release is because for three days i kept telling myself that there is an up tempo cd. i didn't mind cd1&2 out of place pop tracks i didn't mind the different types of music being played in sequence or rather out of sequence. i didn't mind hotel lobby music that reminded me of a hotel i stayed in two years ago in vienna. all this will be forgivable when i hear the up-tempo because i was so sure it's going to be awesome. unfortunately i was not quite right about my assumptions. things did not start happening until track 5 (the reducer 2) i don't really need some 4 tracks on the third cd to get me warmed up. jimmy warmed me up for 37 tracks before that in his down + mid-tempo crap. for the most part this production of the balance series - especially the first 41 tracks in sequence - churned out some of the most lethargic way too slow and boring music that could be described at best as lullabies for grown ups. as for the last 9 tracks of the up-tempo it is actually - dare i say - decent enough but way too late and even worse ended prematurely. it should have been re-arranged with tracks in reverse order on every cd to be as follows: (cd3) up-tempo should have been (cd1) renamed (in the car from club to home) (cd2) mid-tempo should have been renamed (at home in the living room) and finally (cd1) down-tempo should have been (cd3) renamed (in your bedroom). this just makes more sense. the reason i say this is due to the disproportionate figures of dance tracks given to us (9) to the rest of the sleepy mellow ones (41). for example chill out house almost always start with a faster track or two then goes on to be slower gradually. i have never come across a chill cd that opened with 10 fast tracks and ended with 03 slow ones that's not chill. jvm balance did exactly that; took forever to ascend to a certain point then crashed almost immediately. what gives? half star for cd1 half star for cd2 3 stars for cd3 my human side: dance music is not the only type of beautiful music out there duh! jimmy made that very clear in this release. if you want to listen to a wide range of (not bad!) music then balance 10 is for you. dive in jvm selection of what he thinks makes us human; expressions of the soul that goes beyond our daily necessities to survive. as a matter of fact we don't even need music (or any type of arts for that matter) to survive at all. still we listen to it we crave it and for many people their livelihood depends on it. music can represent our feelings desires and wishes and with jvm deep forest like music here (as i mentioned before) i can't help but wonder if he is going through a certain period in his life where spirituality and oneness with the world is a priority. i think it shows. ,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative

 get off the drugs guys. your reviews made me purchase this awful load of tripe. while proficient enough on the instruments and vocals the moon falls woefully short just about everywhere else. the songs sound very similar to one another and are all pretty much void of any decent melodies or even a good hook or two. right when it seems they might be getting somewhere they break the rhythm and make a feeble attempt to psych it up or out with a sitar swirling strings or the ever constant and really abused minor key chord changes. there is also a curious lack of any decent choruses here. i have to believe that that was a conscious effort on the part of the moon. bad idea guys. and while the music is pretty lame the lyrics are absolutely wretched. can anyone out there after listening to this remember more than ten words from any song on this washed out cd? if you can it's because they're so lame and uninspiring. the lyrics from the temptations' psychadelic shack captures the feeling of the sixties better than anything these blotterheads came up with. here's a big hint about the musical contents of this cd. it actually says on the front cover featuring david marks of the beach boys. huh??? is that supposed to be a ringing endorsement? comparing these guys to left banke the zombies or the beatles is pure blasphemy! for those of you fortunate enough to not have heard the moon before count your lucky stars. if you feel yourself slipping to the dark side (the boneheads giving this 4 or 5 stars) and feel like spending some extra cash there are other sixties groups more worthy of your money like the aforementioned bands. i'm probably going to piss some people off with this review but that's exactly how i felt after giving this cd a listen. honestly i immediately thought of george harrison's less than stellar second rate efforts while listening to this. i love ya george but you put out more than one clinker of a northern song. if bad harrison's your thing......well then stop reading and buy this cd now! for the rest of you there's a lot of music from somewhat obscure sixties bands coming out on cd right now. garage or psych a lot of it is great but the mine is also getting stipped pretty bare. the moon is proof positive. it's also pretty easy to see why their recording company called it quits after two albums - and the second album is far superior to the first in both sound and content! in closing while this album has overwhelming intracasies layered into the music and vocals the end product is very bland. i read these guys admitted to cutting these songs while under the influence of lsd. it shows! i rated this aural adventure two stars instead of one for two reasons. first i kept rooting for these guys to come up with a decent song to salvage the album (actually two). they never did but at least they performed all original songs. it's also worth an added star to see a rerelease from a sixties band that doesn't have a cover of hey joe on it. if you're still with me (and also a lover of good music or even mediocre fare) avoid this cd like the plague! i'd also like to thank amazon for putting this clinker on my recommendation lists. you done me wrong ,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative
 this will be the third time i have tried to post a review of this unacceptably bad album and i suppose i have been too harsh because neither of my previous efforts have been posted. lets keep this one simple. this is not music plain and simple. i purchased this due to glowing recommendations from other reviewers on this site and was terribly disappointed. it basically consists of massively distorted (and detuned) guitar and bass monotonously droning on and on for nearly an hour with no coherence structure or anything approximating the actual ability to play an instrument. call it performance art experimental noise whatever. it's simply not music. ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 i first heard this album in the late 6o's when it was originally released. starting with the first track &quot;blood of the sun&quot; i was hooked. leslie west was and has been a vastly unnoticed guitarist treasure. his throaty singing and driving band featuring felix pappalardi made this band one that should be placed on the list of &quot;great ones&quot;. probably due to the many other better publicized bands like led zeppelin and the like leslie west and mountain seemed to get shoved away into the closet. open the closet you guitarists out there and give this cd a try. i don't think you will be anything but delighte ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative

 it's hard to believe this music is more than a quarter century old now. i think it would recieve the same kind of accolades if had come out yesterday. but it didn't. it came out in the summer of 1979. it was the summer before my sophomore year in college my first summer away from home. for at least a week anytime it was my turn to put something on the turntable i'd select side 1 of rust never sleeps. it took me at least that long to flip the darn thing over. and then when i did for the next week anytime it was my turn to put something on the turntable i'd select side 2 of rust never sleeps. my flatmates never complained. oddly the songs i see getting the most grief in the reviews here are my faves. you don't really want to do without the swooping lead guitar contagious handclaps and hysterically funny yet politically cutting chorus of welfare mothers now do you really? as for sedan delivery i have only the vaguest clue of what it's about but it's sure a scorcher (and it's still hard to find a job). allright maybe we don't need two versions of hey hey my my but which one would you delete? as far as i'm concerned there's only one song here that hasn't withstood the test of time: sail away which is innocuously pretty but lacks the bark and bite of even the other acoustic stuff. trasher and pocahontas are both beautiful and mean in just the right amounts and places. poor marlon poor csn. do i wax nostalgiac? perhaps but not overly so. this remains essential neil which is to say as essential as rock 'n roll gets. it still sounds fresh and relevant. and fun. did i mention fun? in fact i'm gonna go plunk it on right now maybe take a breather between sail away and powderfinger to relive the lp experience. you should too. ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive
 if you do not own this album you must get your hand on a copy. it is the best debut album since definatly mayby. tracks like &quot;golden touch&quot; &quot;v.i.c.e&quot; well lets just say every song on the album is a bonnifide hit including the banging&quot;stumbble and fall&quot; which will have you tapping your toes from the first 2 seconds. if you like the libretines or the others or are just looking for a solid cd this is a must have ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 this is part 2 of a set titled say it right. the cd has a blue and white style vs. the part 1 that has a yellow and white style on disc and cover. also in a slim-line jewel case with the title track non-album track but an added dance remix plus video. if you enjoyed the first 2-track cd then this is a must. dance lovers will definitely find this to be a totally spectacular production. say it right [radio edit] has the catchy dance beats nice vocals excellent drums and chorus. the lyrics are fun to sing along and strong in meaning. apparently it's about not giving a lover power to control destroy or make you loose sleep. the melody has great rhythm chorus dance styles and energetic beats. you don't mean nothing at all to me is repeated showing a strong message that life doesn't end with someone who isn't right. what i wanted brings nelly to a slower tempo displaying depth of emotion. it's a slow ballad with true sincerity and humility. it's about going for something you wanted but never got. the outcome doesn't matter because the reality is you gave it your all. as she sings about her dream and what she wanted it's apparent love can be hard to let go yet comforting to do so. the melody is soothing pleasant in sound and refreshing for the soul. say it right [peter rauhofer remix part 1] is a hot club remix sure to get you dancing off your feet. the song takes a dive to faster paced trance like effects different introduction pumping jamming dance styles with techno flairs up and down tempos as well as plenty of percussion and synthesizers. straying from the original song the vocals are still vastly heard yet filled with echoes swirls of sounds and much club ambiance. it's dreamy fantasy filled and definitely highly paced for the dance floor. if anything is certain it is this: the remix in this cd is much better than many of her past singles. there is true dj styles incorporation more instrumentations effects and vast production much more geared to club hoppers and dance fans. quite sticky infectious and groove like this remix will get you dancing up a storm feeling like wanting to shake your body non-stop. club lovers don't pass this out. nelly's vocals are echoed often and electronic-a effects are vastly hard. say it right video [enhanced cd] is the video many have already seen as timbaland and nelly dance face to face and get very close as the message behind the music is reinforced. this is an excellent video with much dance styles highly energetic beats and flairs for control and getting the message across. overall from all of nelly's singles i find this to be on the top of my favorite. the combination of 2 highly emotional yet different songs plus a dance track and video makes this remarkable. definitely buy this if you are a nelly fan club hopper or a lover of music to enjoy for the depth of emotion different styles displayed and the themes. it's definitely a top sensation. before it sells out be sure to buy it. the part 1 is also an excellent addition for those days you don't want to listen to the remix. this is highly recommended for sure! ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 i used to listen to a friend's copy of the original metal box of ep's when it first came out. years later the second edition came out on lp's for those of us who hadn't sprung for the metal box before it sold out. eventually the second edition came out on this cd. so i finally could own a digital copy myself. pristine audio quality at least as good as the original metal box in my opinion if i remember correctly. you do need to listen to this. you do need to buy a copy and get other people to listen to this too ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative
 michelle branch carved out a place for herself in the young female pop singer market serveral years ago with a brilliant debut and a successful if derivitive duet with carlos santana. this record is her first with friend jessica harp. the ladies mine the borderline between the singer/songwriter and country genres for quality songs that should fit well in the americana format. highlights include the opening track leave the pieces way back home the good kind and the title track stand still look pretty. of special note is the presence of producer/multi-instrumentalist john leventhal on many tracks. i recommend this record for folks who like songs that don't sound like formula country ,positive,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative

 ignore the unique cover clever song idea( there is 30) which represent a comic book. ignore all that. it simply is not good. what is this? i dont even know how to describe this music. it's not even songs but more a bunch of really short experimental non-sensequel inerworkings of annoyance. they will start off with a riff as if they are going on to a song but its only a tease until they stop and go slow to say get on with it!!!!!!!! add a bunch of zany sound effects not to mention the recurring anoyance of a high pitched voice ringing out sci-fi clips and completly hoarse vocals that are screams and soundsthat add upto one of the most pointless albums ever put out ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 this film came out in 1973 and i saw it in its original full length version (about 3hours and 15 min.) executives from columbia pictures were there it was the premeire and they were groaning and at the intermission fights broke out(verbal) and ushers passed among them and myself and everyone else with soundtrack albums. the executives left the theatre and scaled the albums across columbus circle in boston and i and a few friends retrieved them and had quite a few for free. we returned to the film and i have always loved this crazy redition of lost horizon the miscasting the terrible sets the odd ball music for the story the dubbed liv ullmann the dance routines of olivia hussey..all of it. you cannot find a musical like it or a soundtrack like it. columbia execs were unimaginative; they should have believed in this film. the next day after this premeire in boston new york etc. (simultaneous i suppose) the film was cut the posters were taken down..there was a ton of material to buy..t shirts dolls posters of all sizes bath towels with the poster on them records of the sd tk of course and small pop up sets of the entire film. it was to be a massive hit..in two days time all of the paraphanalia was removed and the posters said last two weeks and in two weeks the whole thing disappeared. but many people came to see it..lines of people and when they heard it had been cut they gave up and in two weeks everyone said farewell to this film. i have many treasures from that opening nite and now i have the cd of the sound track. anyone who loves movie magic or madness has to see and hear this film; it is unique. enjoy this soundtrack and get your hands on a dvd ..they are out there ,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative
 a ridiculously good album. this is as good an introduction to jawbox as you're going to find. it's got most of their really great songs plus some live songs which are great. another good thing is that desoto records (the label that was started by the band) has re-released the cd so it shouldn't be as hard to find ,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative
 i rarely write reviews but i need to comment on how fantastic this compilation is. i have a four-year-old and an eighteen-month-old and this cd is in heavy rotation at our house. my husband and i love the music at least as much as they do -- it's stylish and sets a great mood as we're making dinner and doing dishes. the kids love it too needless to say. my four-year-old's favorites are three blind mice (she loves when the farmer's wife squeaks that she'll give back the tails) and the final track by peggy lee (where she says the word *poop* as in party poop -- endless laughter ensues). ella fitzgerald's a-tisket a-tasket and chew chew your bubblegum are priceless. all in all i highly recommend this cd -- everyone will be happy to hear it again and again ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 made another bull**** album. honestly i didn't hear this whole album. about 5 years ago i was ridin wit one of my boys and he played this cd. oh my god for the first time in my life i wished i was deaf. i see the reason why her albums sell though. cause its her looks and nothin else. she's not ugly at all to me. she just can't sing. but she can livin up a crowd. i'm just waitin to see her and 50 cent doin a song together two of the worst people in music millionaires. go figure ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative

 few metal bands can successfully integrate melody into their music without falling back on the overused power ballad. tesla seems to be able to turn it on when needed and shut it off when unnecessary. this debut from the sacramento quintet is full of enough speed to satisfy any metalhead yet also contains enough substance to satisfy those who want more from their rock than double kicks and 140 on the metronome. the album starts off with a great rythym section groove then growing and ripping into ez cum ez go a song that takes the listener up and down more often than a valencia theme park ride. comin' atcha live seems destined to be the song that the band opens their live shows with falling back into the rif-filled melodic offering of getting better. then the pace swells again into too late for love and thunders into the anthemic fist-pumping rock me to the top. we're no good together may start like the dreaded power ballad as jeff keith laments about the proverbial one that got away but screams to a conclusion through a profusion of lightning fast (pun intended) guitar solos. modern day cowboy is the token political anti-war statement slows down a bit for changes but up next is one of their fans' favorites. little suzi begins with a tasty acoustic piece and progresses into the culmination of the bands' melodic songwriting talents as they chronical the ups and downs (pun intended) of a young starlet discovering the high costs of fame. i'm a little surprised at the way the album closes though. after the huge highs through the middle of the album the final three cuts are somewhat disappointing to me. don't get me wrong they're still decent but i would have liked these three shifted to the middle of the album and slid the rest towards the end - little suzi would have been a great way to end the album. overall even though the band did a lot of great stuff (including their biggest commercial success) in later albums this remains their best body of work ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive
 this is by far one of the most beautiful recordings made by the bill evans trio. this was i'm told bill's first all ballads record. riverside records released it on vinyl way back in 1962. none of the music sounds dated. considering it's 41 years old. this is the first recording bill made with chuck israels taking over for the late scott lafaro as the bass player. this album has a very haunting and romantic feeling to it. the music is sad in tone and suggests feelings of longing and sobering reflection. one goal that bill always strived for was to ballance intellect with passion to make intelligent and original sounding jazz. i dont even know if jazz is the right stamp to put on this recording. to me it sounds more like european classical music. also thank god for bill's college music theory teacher at southeastern university gretchen magee. because if it werent for her motivation {evans often thought of his work as unsatisfactory and sometimes needed alot of motivation from from bandmates and peers} he might not have composed his gorgeous original composition very early {which is the last track on the cd its just breathtaking...}being an amature pianist myself very early and childrens play song were the first two evans' compositions i taught myself to play. the piece is a composition played in c major at a slow waltz tempo. he played the tune until the end of his life in 1980 but the original version on moonbeams might be the all around finest one. it is given a very slow and delicate treatment and when he restates the theme at the end you can almost feel an imagrey of leaves or snow falling gently around you. i also really like his interpretation of it might as well be spring. i think that bill evans was a beautiful person and pianist because he was never flashy and this album proves that. he didnt play anything he didnt have to. he always played just the right amount of notes and chords. with this record it all comes together coherently to make a truly stunning musical statement. evans once told tony bennet to forget everything else and just concentrate on truth and beauty. with the album moonbeams fans of evans' music and important legacy will clearly be able to hear his own truth and beauty about life glowing from this gorgeous album. highly recommended ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 i have never been able to see what the big deal was about this band. all of their records in general sound exactly the same and this one is no exception. post-velvets guitar/organ drones lackadaisical vocals blankly uninteresting non-lyrics (they could have recited their grocery lists and it would have been more interesting) and a dramatic lack of energy; all of yo la tengo's trademarks are fully represented here and if you can stay awake through it you're a better man/woman than i. a surpassingly boring record even from this usually very boring band. if you've heard the velvet underground neu! stereolab's early records and sonic youth you've heard yo la tengo in total. if you're a big enough fan of those named bands you could probably write songs that sound like &quot;painful.&quot; but you would probably write better ones. avoid this like the plague unless you suffer from insomnia ,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 ...heart-wrenching break-up with his girlfriend of 8 years elastica's justine frishmann. 13 is a dark record produced by william orbit. nearly every song is injected with despair sorrow bitterness and an achy heart-breaking sadness. these moods are encompassed on such tracks as tender 1992 battle and the tear-jerking no distance left to run. also included are the trip-hop masterpiece trimm trabb the humourous trailerpark and b.l.u.r.e.m.i. and coxon and albarn's co-written pop-masterpiece coffee and tv ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative

 hiphop as a genre is so wide spread and international that sometimes we get wonderful creative jems like lady sovereign. she is not only lyrically impressive but the mixes of electronics on all her tracks will get you moving which is basically what she sets out to do. i dont know much about the hip hop insprised grime scene in the uk but i will definitely be keeping on eye out now. and i will patiently await for s.o.v. debut us album. favorite track though all of it is really good will have to be the battle feature other grime scene artists like shystie zuz rock and frost p spitting the wildest (barely understandable lol) rhymes ive heard. no men and women have battled against each other like this especially for the listening public. how ever no one should compare sov to anyone (missy or m.i.a.) all emcees particularly female one have a different style and should be prasied for such. sov has a style totally different from anything ive heard to date. it's refreashing to see a new spin on hiphop. ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive
 i'm surprised this show got past season 1. honestly more talent can be found in my local karaoke bar. this show does not discover talent they produce and market it. it is really demeaning to musicians everywhere. the judges are a joke i guess the producers tell them what to say. simon the jerk cowell tries hard to be rude to everyone hey...he has made a living out of it. randy jackson's vocab is limited to yo yeah and dawg. paula who's the only one who i think deserves to even comment on the singers..unfortunately praises everyone be it for their performance/energy/character/looks/(fill with any word of your choice). all in all a total disaster...only in shows this sh*tty can no-talents like william hung be hailed as a celebrity. i am shocked people other than the families of those participating would actually spend time and money voting for these posers. on a more positive note it's good that people don't actually buy the albums thus resulting in total disappearing acts from idol winners like ruben and fantasia...now we just need the american public to stop tuning in to the shows. well hope is all we have right ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 ac/dc is no doubt one of the best rock bands of all time but they are not growing as musicians. sure they can rock like they used too but they seem to be out of ideas. the well is dry. put out a anthology already!!! at least my favorite band deep purple keep coming up with good stuff and with imagination! the fact that purple's music continues to fascinate as well as puzzle after all this time is evidence we are dealing with art of the highest caliber. anyway better luck next time angus & co. stiff upper lip ~ ac/dc : 2 stars ,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive

 this movie was a favorite in our household and my daughters always enjoyed the karaoke a the end of the dvd so we searched for the soundtrack. i actually chose this volume over volume 1 for two reasons...it contains the favorite from the movie i want to grow old with you actually sung by adam sandler and secondly because volume 1 contains the song that adam sandler sings about his ex-girlfriend which contains quite a bit of profanity so i didn't want to get it for my kids. i would have given it five stars but we find the introduction by billy idol at the start of the last track i want to grow old with you which is dialog from the movie to be distracting and it gets tiring to have to listen to over and over when you just want to hear the song which i mentioned was the absolute favorite ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative
 this is a difficult album to review. people either embrace it or pass it off as an overproduced overblown waste of their time. however i can say that this is my favorite oasis album. why? that's a very good question...maybe because be here now was my introduction to oasis and i could tell that this band had a lot to offer even through the drug-addled overproduced songs that seemed to last forever. each one is very catchy and has an overall feel-good quality to it two characteristics of most oasis songs. it's no use comparing be here now to morning glory or def. maybe because it's in a whole other ballpark. this is oasis going totally over the top and pushing their music to the limit. no doubt that all the coke helped with that. it's my firm belief that morning glory and def. maybe were and still are great albums in their own rights. be here now is just something else you either love it or hate it. it has it's own little oasis category. i can see why it never really lived up to its two famous predecessors. there are some valid complaints about this album though. one it is very very overproduced filled to the top with snarling buzzing guitars and who knows what else. unfortunately this makes it hard to listen to with earphones for very long. two the songs are astonishingly long at times. all around the world while an excellent song clocks in at around 9:20. i believe that the shortest song is i hope i think i know coming in at 4:23. so you know you're in for a long wild ride. however only oasis could pull this off - making ridiculously long songs that are almost ear-numbing to listen to - and every minute is made enjoyable. all the arrogance coke and swagger in these songs is perhaps what makes it so appealing to some people. and of course there's that small note on the upper left-hand corner of pages 7 and 8 in the booklet that proclaims : the beatles are quite good but oasis is much better. and so a resounding yes to all of these: overproduced arrogant drug-induced staggering amazing excellent. i don't care about the negative things though because that's what makes be here now a sucess in its own right. ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative

 it is hard to imagine what the american songbook ever did to rod stewart that he would decide to degrade it like this not once not twice but three times. stewart's decision to approach these shop-worn standards ranks up there with napoleon's decision to invade russia during the winter it is staggeringly ill conceived. the problem of course is his voice. the selection of material seems ideally suited to showcase his limitations as a singer which are countless. for starters he has almost no range at all. next his raspiness has no inherent beauty and these are songs intended for beautiful voices. by their very nature the selections are vehicles for skilled singers their simplicity allows excellent performers to interpret and express individual perspective. stewart because he is a rock and blues singer never learned the fundamentals of singing and certainly never developed a mature expressive voice. he scratches along the surface of these listless vehicles with the charm of a man skating over ice with sandpaper strapped to his shoes. banks of strings and fabulously misguided collaborations (dolly parton!) do not mask but highlight what is wrong with this project. bear in mind that i like rod stewart; he's from scotland and he's the prototypical brit blues belter. if you want to know what he's actually good at dig out your copy of jeff beck's first release truth. stewart delivers some of the best blue-eyed twelve bar wailing ever recorded. but that's the problem. on truth it was the cigarettes whisky and swagger in his voice that made him great - it wasn't about singing technique - it was about authenticity. here the focus is on singing and his limitations are embarrassingly spotlighted. albums like this never get made unless the performer already has name recognition that guarantees sales nightmares of this stripe could never stand on their own merits. to be avoided at all cost. ,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,positive
 wow! there's sooooo... much to like in this album it's amazing. the music is mostly upbeat & very catchy--making you want to (& will if no one's around) sing along. the lyrics are fine meaningful & personally touching--about life which is getting faster & faster in the contemporary world while people are still people with hopes feelings needs desires & all the rest of what makes people human. the lead singer jennifer nettles is powerful yet gifted with a sweet voice (though a bit twangy in style). she grabs you quickly for a wild ride--immersing the listener in the musical story she's telling. i bought the cd based on hearing baby girl & something more (on the tv show vegas of all place). then i heard sugarland on the cma show--winning awards as they so deserve. the range & variety of the songs on the album are good too--from sweet & poignant ballads to wild & spicy soaring. virtually all of the songs are well worth listening to & the majority could become successful singles. yes the style is their own mixture of influences--the 3 artists come from different musical backgrounds which makes their wonderful blending are the more impressive. and the trio wrote all the songs on the cd--with hall the primary author (solo writer on one of them). how many trios are there with 2 women & 1 man? i wonder if they are unique? well they are unique even if not in that respect--how many bands include a mandolin?. of course country purists may not be happy with them but the vast majority of listeners are. this has become one of my favorite albums at the speed of sound. imho it's terrific ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative

 growing up with classical rock and having enjoyed rock music by rod stewart i didn't think i'd like this cd. one evening i was having dinner at a friend's home and they had this one playing. it was beautiful. being a little older now (in my early 40's) i enjoy more mellow music than the head banging variety that is heard now. this cd of rod's was nostalgic romantic and extremely easy to listen to. ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
 watching the melvins evolve was extremely interesting and entertaining. they began as an unassuming punk band and proceded to incorporate the heaviness of 70's rock into their sound. then they stripped away any and all of the punk trappings and went for pure heavy. it all culminated with this record. it just doesn't get any heavier than 'roman bird dog/hung bunny'. 'with teeth' rumored to actually be written by joe preston is one of my all time favorite melvins songs. speaking of joe preston he was the by far best of the melvins' 7000+ bassists they had over the years. shame they got rid of him shortly after this album. as soon as they fired him they went straight down the greased pole to mediocrity hell. bad karma. thank god that rock bands record their music so that it isn't lost forever every time they make stupid decisions. the only song on this record which i don't like is the cover of alice cooper's 'the ballad of dwight fry'. thankfully they made up for it with a cover of flipper's 'sacrifice'. some of the melvins' subsequent records have their moments (stoner witch's 'shevil' stag's 'cotton mouth') but for the most part it seems to me that the melvins gave up the ghost after recording this. maybe someday they'll make a comeback ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive

 for someone who knows little about bach and wants to learn something you couldn't do better than to give them this cd. ormandy and the philadelphia orchestra give their signature warm plush sound to the work of the great johann sebastian bach making him sound very nearly like a romantic rather than a baroque or classical composer. this is not a bad thing--some complain that bach with his mathematical leanings leaves them cold. that isn't possible with the inviting material on this cd ,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative
 this cd shocked me. at first i was listening and enjoying the beats on every track. but then listening to the actual content of each song b*tch this and h*e that. come on as a young female how am i supposed to bump this in my car? every single song on the cd is disrespectful. you know what really makes me mad this is what's supposed to be hot popular. what kind of message is this sending to our young black men? our young women? i would not recommend this for any one especially anyone under the age of 16 or any woman. ,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative
 i remember really liking this album when it was first released even though i could tell it was not in the same league as the real thing or angel dust. listening to the album now i realise it is by far the worst fnm album since mike patton joined. the whole album feels very rushed it has a sparse raw sound very different to angel dust's polish. the music is generally very simple with many tracks sounding like b-sides and lacks the consistent melodiousness and sense of rhythm of their previous two classic albums. it was a shame to see guitarist jim martin depart. he had an unmistakable style and crunching guitar sound and was an integral part of fnm's style and make up. however being replaced (for a short time anyway) by trey spruance is no bad thing - anyone familiar with his work with mr bungle will know he is a genius with a guitar and his work here on king for a day is excellent it's just a shame that the material he has to work with is largely uninspired. how ironic then that on such a disappointing album fnm produce one of their greatest ever tracks - the title track is pure genius full of the care and effort rhythm and melodiousness fnm were famous for. beginning with a great bass riff and acoustic strum it is soon joined by a gentle female voice effect and simple minor piano scale and then brilliantly builds into a tour de force of percussion and guitar work before cleverly returning to the gentle acoustic sounds of the intro where it carefully takes 2 and a half minutes to wind down beautifully - this is fnm as you'd expect them. another track that deserves special mention is cuckoo or caca a great metal piece with excellent percussion and keyboards and crazy vocals. it's scorching and funy and another reminder of the greatness fnm once held in abundance. it's just a shame that these moments of inspiration are surrounded by so much surprising blandness (caralho voador take this bottle the last to know) and 2nd rate metal (ugly in the morning what a day get out). star a.d. could have been vintage fnm but in the end falls flat evidence starts off interestingly enough but soon gets boring and metal tracks like ricochet the gentle art of making enemies and digging the grave are simple and sound like what most student bands are writing. however the album does end on another note of vintage fnm - just a man is funny and catchy with patton having fun doing his tom jones impression and the inclusion of a gospel choir at the end is inspired - you find yourself not wanting it to end. patton's vocals throughout the album are still amazing but should be accompanying much better material and you can't help but feel he was a little bored here - i think his heart always really lay with the far superior mr bungle where he really shone and where his voice was absolutely perfect for the complex and avant garde material. i suppose it's not surprising that king for a day is a largely empty affair the departure of jim martin and the diminished presence of roddy bottum at rehearsals meant that fnm's original chemistry and resources were sadly lacking and so were unable to achieve what they once had been able to. it's really an album for faith no more fans it's certainly no classic despite some classic material and i feel it was the beginning of the end for fnm they would improve with their next album album of the year - but only marginally. ,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative

 it tiptoes through the years and delivers the punch but as i wrote in my review i never thought shangri la was going to be the last though it appears just that. but all in the suit man they did that after shangri la de and i wonder if this was the direction to come my god!!!! it's worth it for that track alone.. 5 stars is my own way of saying thank you but it is not just sentimental the only album in the short career that wasn't great was tiny music but the quote trippin made up for it. it's a shame it's over. i don't like revolver it's not evolution for weiland and i can't imagine him being happy there it steps back and all i ever hoped was that someday this band stp would reign supreme and been given the praise and adulation they deserve. all i can do is give stars but i would rather buy another stp album or go see them live...is rock dead? i think it is and it went with this band ,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative,positive

 this is a great cd! each track fades up to full volume at the start and fades down to silence at the end. this makes it nice to just play the entire cd or to loop one track since there are no sharp changes from one noise to another. so far the car and washing machine tracks seem to be our baby's favorites. when she outgrows the need for this white noise cd we'll transition her to lullaby or classical music. for now though this cd helps us keep her on a schedule and well rested by helping keep her relaxed and usually asleep during her nap times. as a bonus the waves and rain on the roof tracks are soothing for grown-ups needing to drown out noise while they sleep ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 i've owned this cd but didn't keep it for very long because it's too poppy and slick for my tastes. i guess when about 1981 came around billy just wanted to distance himself from the brilliance of his 70's style and on this offering he kind of wanted a 50's or 60's kind of sound. this stuff is just to slick for this hombre. he never made a solid album after the release of glass houses in about 1980. this is the kind of stuff that yuppies rave about but if you've got some integrity you'll probably want to steer clear of this one and buy anything he recorded in the 70's ,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

 more like 3.5. so. half of this album is excellent. the rest is filler. but due to times like these all my life disenchanted lullaby (the intro irritates me but it gets better) have it all (kinda sappy but i love the intro) low (have you seen the video?) and overdrive (again kinda sappy but there's something about it i love) the album is pretty enjoyable. it doesn't compare to the first three but it has its moments. the riffs are slightly heavier most songs are pretty upbeat. times like these is an instant classic with awesome lyrics while all my life rocks harder than pretty much all previous songs. kinda sucks how the best songs are/were singles but if they had released other songs no-one would buy the album. mind you my friend loves burn away so listen to the previews and make your own mind up ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
 ms. melua is from georgia. her voice is quite like the swede lisa ekdahl. neither has range or power; both have a little girl voice and plenty of finesse. both have musical partners. in ms. melua's case it is mike batt who is to her what nelson riddle was to linda rondstadt except that in addition to arranging and conducting and coaching he writes songs. most of this album are her and/or his songs. they are well written and well treated. they are are a careful team abnd do not cut corners. mr. batt among many other things worked with steeleye span and art garfunkel long ago. the original sogs are interesting and liquid pleasant in rendition. but my favorite cut is her rendering blues in the night which some might remember from looney tunes cartoons many decades past; my mama done tole me... it starts. knowing she cannot belt it instead she works it. one short note on steve sale's engineering because another reviewer was crabbing about reverb and above all clipping. perhaps because i bought it on vinyl but i hear none of these defects. my set is revealing and it reveals excellent engineering considering the largeish ensemble mr. batt has assembeled. fear not unless the cd really is badly made ,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative
 very rich in music fully orchestrated and full of energy. i highly recommend this album for everyone who loves new age music and to all those who like classical music. david took it to another level on this one. i myself like new age artists that incorporate orchestra to their music and that is why i loved this album. if you like this album i recommend you to explore yanni secret garden giovanni and bernward koch ,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,negative
 this is a really great follow up to allison moorer's debut album alabama song. the hardest part her sophomore cd was released two years after her debut in september 2000. it builds on the sound presented on her first and the songs are nothing short of great. my favorite track though not her own is her emotional reading of the rolling stones' &quot;bring me all your lovin&quot;. she makes this song into her own. &quot;no next time&quot; is another favorite the lyrics are excellent a great breakup song. the title track is a nice midtempo country number. &quot;send down an angel&quot; is very sad but touching at the same time. other highlights include &quot;it's time that i tried&quot; &quot;day you said goodbye&quot; &quot;is it worth it&quot; and &quot;feeling that feeling again&quot;. overall to me this is her best album. you can't go wrong with any of them but this is an artistic acheivement and one of her best albums yet ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative

 this has to be one of the most beautiful cds ever recorded. damien's vocal range is vast; his musicianship excellent; but it's the crafting of songs at which he truly surpasses most artists. haunting sensitive flowing crashing...

 this album is one of the only live albums that i don't have. i have heard samples and a few extra songs on other cds though. the first thing i hear from somebody that tell about this album is basically that stevie couldn't have been more high. his performance was just imbarrassing for the other members in the group (specifically reese wynans). most poeple don't know this but on the old vinyl copy of this album (i've never heard it but someone told me) there was originally a 14th track. it was the song that usually comes close to the end of stevie's sets. the song was life without you. since it was the very last song i'm guessing stevie was more pooped than ever beacause it was the last song and that he was extremely high and everything. being high is one thing but being high and playing your last song in a set is terrible. in the old vinyl disc stevie was on his last song and he was so terribly slow that reese wynans walked off stage embarrased and discusted. this track was taken off the album because of its discracefulness ,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative,negative

 without a doubt the highlight is the dvd of the 1975 show in london. born to run the album had put him on the cover of time and newsweek the same week in october 1975 one of the very few times that has happened for a non-news story. the publicity and hype generated by columbia records was so overwhelming that there was a backlash: nobody can be that good. so here we see his first show ever in the uk playing to an audience of professional critics and amateur skeptics people thinking hey 'rock and roll future' this is the land of the beatles the rolling stones the who - who do you think you're kidding. no unknown kid from america deserves 'time' and 'newsweek.' the show begins in almost total darkness a piano softly plays then harmonica and a soft spotlight lights the kid from new jersey who sings thunder road accompanied by only piano. an unknown song at the time thunder road has become a springsteen classic. imho especially given the expectations it is a perfect understated opening. the dvd has the entire show including everything from the hard rock of she's the one and born to run the song to a much slowed down version of for you an underated sleeper on his first album greeting from asbuty park nj. bruce accompanies himself on the piano and i swear this version of for you is so beautiful it could be the scruffy new jersey kid channeling god. any skeptic who walked out of this show thinking springsteen was merely hype has no ears no taste or was xenophobic. the show gives more than a big hint that this springsteen guy is for real as a songwriter and performer and that born to run especially is an extraodinary album. there are only eight songs but none are fill. repeated listenings of the four corners of the album (before cds) backstreets jungleland thunder road and the title song are so good they become... well addictive works of genius and lead to still more listening. tenth avenue freeze out night and especially she's the one could each be the centerpiece of almost any other album. even the whispered meeting across the river fits and helps the album become a coherent whole. the songs taken together are more than the sum of the parts. as a footnote i'll offer the opinion that bruce only wrote one other album that is as good as born to run and that is his next one darkness on the edge of town. everything he has released is good; a good bit of it is great but i don't think anything else matches born to run or darkness. i don't know if two other back to back albums this good have ever been released. the dvd of the show gives us a big early peek at the guy who would develop into rock's greatest performer. by 1985 he would be the biggest rock star in the world selling out multiple nights at football stadiums. the remastered cd is nothing special to my ears. perhaps an audiophile could hear improvement. the dvd the making of 'born to run' is interesting but will probably appeal mainly to fans. however the dvd of the 1975 london show ought to appeal to anyone who likes bruce or rock & roll or showmanship or history. its a treat ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
 i think this my first ep purchase ever - and i generally feel that despite the quality many offer eps just are not worth it. sam beam was clearly on a mission to change my mind as these apparent outtakes from the creek drank the cradle are every bit as good as that miracle debut - if not better. i only very recently discovered iron and wine through our endless numbered days and have since been backtracking only to see that this remarkably talented artist can do no wrong. the standout track to me is the night descending it has the feel of a track pulled right out of the past. the other four tracks are just as excellent though and i think sam's managed to make an avid fan out of me. damn... and just when i thought there were no new artists to be excited about! ,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative
 there's nothing outrageous about the title song - it's a lame mind-numbing piece of crap compared to many other songs found on the in the zone album: imagine breathe on me touch of my hand or shadow on constant radio play or running on mtv. and no we're not apparently going to have that because britney's precious time was wasted in incorporating this bore of a song into a single and even attempting a video out of it like we know ended up in britney's injury. for nothing. fortunately for this single it's got the already legendary toxic and a marvelous vocal mix version of everytime - another star for that. ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 burnin' was the last album by the wailers as a collective group afterwhich peter tosh and bunny wailer left the group to pursue solo careers and marley reformed his group calling it bob marley & the wailers in 1974. the album shows the original three at their best balancing lead vocals on several songs between bob marley bunny wailer and peter tosh. the album not only serves to further reveal bob's soon-to-be legendary work but also to show the talent of bunny wailer with his lead vocals on songs like hallelujah time and pass it on. the album also shows tosh taking lead with marley on one foundation and alongside marley on get up stand up. the album's biggest gem however was i shot the sheriff soon to be made a favorite in the u.s. and the u.k. by rock artist eric clapton on his 1974 451 ocean boulevard album. the deluxe edition also features a concert from the tour in leeds u.k. just one week before the wailers broke up. (bunny however was already absent having refused to tour outside of jamaica once and for all earlier that year. his temporary replacementthe wailers' old vocal coach joe higgs was also absent quitting the tour after they completed their shows in the u.s.) 1973's burnin' shows the original wailers at their very best before their breakup and is a timeless classic for music fans everywhere i can guarentee it ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,negative,positive,positive
 two of the greatest names in show business at their zenith. there are so many good tracks on this set that it's hard to pick out some over the others. a couple of superb standouts are jolson's swanee and rock-a-bye although every track is just excellent. the sound quality on the set is outstandingly great. i hope the people that put this set together will do the same incredible job with other classic recordings by jolson and crosby ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive

 i can't believe the harshness of some of the comments on this album. not a lot of in between among the notices -- those that hate are mean and heartless. very hurtful. lousy counterpoint to her warmth. i don't think they understand that she doesn't have to lose control to be meaningful and touching. take her as an original instead of as a mimic. what do i hear? i love her lush voice on this album and fred hersch's brilliant piano accompaniment. bill frisell is very good too. i love jazz & pop as well as opera. ren?e fleming can make it any of these genres. these songs are very much her own interpretation. they are 'deeper' than what you've heard before. even if i prefer nancy wilson or eva cassidy singing you've changed ren?e fleming sings it warmly and beautifully in her own style and very touching too. she's not carried by full orchestration mostly just fred and her. i was going to write that my one and only love was especially good but as the cd kept playing i must say that they are all especially good. enjoy ,positive,positive,negative,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative
 there are 2 really good songs on here. the first is untitled which sounds like gibbard was listening to a lot of brian wilson at the time he wrote it. the percussion sounds like it could have been on pet sounds. underwater is a pretty good song...but the real jewel on the album is send packing. it really is a beautiful well-written song. the rest of the album sounds kind of thrown together and most of the songs would have been much better if they had been recorded with real instruments. basically the novelty of the kid instrument thing wears off really quickly. all in all i wouldn't spend 10 bucks on it but a couple tracks are pretty good ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative

 no other compilation of garland's work exemplifies her genius and versatility than this astounding compilation that shows why she was the entertainment phenomenon that took the world by storm. all her original soundtrack performances are here sounding magnificent. far superior to thin-sounding studio re-creations this is the real deal assembled with obvious skill intelligence and dedication to the talented legend. in a sense this should be the soundtrack album for that magnificent documentary about her that pbs produced a while back. don't pass this up ,positive,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,negative

 some will mistake me for a evidence hater but i'm really not. i just want the man to put some effort into what he does. i'm tired of taking just any ol' thing artists throw at us nowadays because the fans don't expect very much -- or simply don't know what good is anymore. sure you can relate to what evidence is saying but you can put on a dope instrumental cd sit with a friend or knowledgable hip hop head have a discussion about any topic and the resulting feeling will be something like the feeling you get from this album. i quickly get tired of the slow flow -- see: talking -- and i feel like anyone can do it. i don't shell out money for things i can do myself. really the only difference between him and 50 cent is content. when i hear someone say slow flow my mind translates that into reduction of standards to make it easier for cats to get on because this album would have been thrown out the window before the jiggy invasion came. and lot of these beats though very dope are as slow as his flow is. couple that with the fact that there are a lot of wack guest appearance from cats like joe scudda (i'm sorry i tried to like him but dude is simply terrible) big pooh (same goes for him) and madchild and you have an album that can have a drowsying effect on the listener. the only dope guest shots come from phonte planet asia and slug. yeah i know the fans and jock riders will hate and call names but i'm going to keep it honest -- fu** real. when ev actually puts his back into it he creates some dope material. down with new york city is nice piece of work that has ev gettin' busy over an air tight jake one track. chase the clouds away is another track where ev does his thing over a pounding alc production. the standout to me had to be line of scrimmage which features ev and atmosphere frontman slug getting nice over another dope alc creation. with the likes of alchemist sid roams jake one dj khalil babu and evidence himself providing dope beats i'd have to say that the production is definitely the strong point of the lp. simply put i don't recommend playing this cd while operating heavy machinery. i respect ev and his whole crew (hell i love rakaa) but this album will make you nod off instead of nod to the beat. i can only call it the way i see it regardless of whether or not the artist is a favorite of mine or not. bring on the unhelpful votes if you want but i can only recommend this to the die hard fans -- who should eat this one up. everyone else should download this and test it out first. standout tracks: letyourselfgo feat. alchemist & phonte a moment in time feat. planet asia line of scrimmage feat. slug (my favorite) and down in new york cit ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 after trouble and his austin city limits appearance i thought he was just another very good singer songwriter. this follow up has made me reconsider because this is the work of a very thoughtful perfectionist. he waited and it was worth the wait. this reminded me immediately of john lennon (please don't punish me for blasphemy) and others that knew how to touch you with simplicity done in a classy way. i didn't expect something this deep for a sophomore recording. enjoy ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative
 i'll begin by saying this isn't the only ministry of sound chillout sessions i've heard in fact i love the mos brand so i can honestly say that every single compilation has it's on flavour from the clubber's guide to to the annual (spring/ summer/ annual) which means the previous and next instalments don't necesarily match this review. with that being said: this particular compilation has a very elegant/ european/ underground feel to it. it's indie electronica and some rock-gone-acid-jazz and of course it wouldn't be european without some house music. it's fascinating that in the middle of an elephant-driven craze a song talking about taking a holiday so someone can love someone better starts to blend seamlessly. yes it's that type of record. it's not pop it's not a 'greatest hits' mash-up and it's definately not boring. i remember the first time i heard it (i was working graveyard shifts at that time) i'd listen to the first cd and it'd make me fall sound asleep after the first half. it's not a bad thing it's just very relaxing very soothing to the soul (specially the lior song this old love which helped me get through a rather painful breakup) overall it's that kind of session. it makes you think it makes you apreciate it it's a 'life soundtrack' from track 1 of the second disc (we all live and die from kinda new) giving you a morning starter to the soothing track run (jacknife lee remix) on the first disc which invites you to the promised dreamland. nothing you'd expect from a regular mos compilation everything you'd expect from a really good chillout compilation. a must for any true chillout junkie ,positive,negative,positive,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive
 unbelievably and indubitably a bona fide and fortified roots reggae album! if you don't have firehouse rock in your cd collection and you consider yourself a reggae fan you may need to re-evaluate what you think you know about jamaican music. the roots radics especially the rythym section utilize (with supreme efficacy i might add) and epitomize the manipulation of space and time so often associated with reggae riddims. on top of the radics the wailing souls add ethereal vocals while staying masterfully conscious. firehouse rock is a beautifully recorded piece of audible jamaican history and an absolute must have ,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive

 did you lose interest in new rock in the past several years because all those loud songs on the fm station sound about the same? maybe you noticed one song in there somewhere that had memorable hooks and interesting lyrics among the crunching guitars? the libertines are - or at least were - one of those diamonds in the rough. their raw loud style is closer to punk than any other genre but most of their songs are more well-developed than that suggests and might even appeal to classic rock fans. make no mistake though this is a loud album. with the exception of the oddly balladish radio america it's a pretty steady sonic assault and the lyrics are mostly somewhere between louie louie and live dylan on the intelligibility scale. what can be understood is more erudite than you'd expect though. what a waster is a frighteningly vivid look at drug addiction boys in the band is the best groupie song i've heard in a long time and the good old days actually reveals a touch of sentimentality just under the power chords. decipherable or not most of the other songs are at least very catchy. the whole collection is a nice balance between aggressive style and memorable songs that has been all too lacking for a long time now. ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
 another solid 70's band that faded into obscurity. the nice thing about living in canada was that we got to see all of the minor as well as the major acts. edward bear fell between the two. the original members got together in the late sixties and took their name from a more famous bear named winnie. all of their hits are here as well as a cover of freedom for the stallion a song that was also covered by the hues corporation and popularized by three dog night. its mostly the type of music that most will remember a favourite love by from the last song to close your eyes (i'm back again). a good middle of the road pop album to melt back the years ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative
 and finding stories of stacks of old vinyls dripping yesterday and glowing always. cali's finest madlib is definitely one of the heirs of dj premiere pete rock dj quik and other previous beat konductas that helped established the sound of true hip-hop as a platform where old school soul and new school technique are amalgamated. the latest madlib invasion is not for everybody; those of us who's butts were undeniably moved by tribe's low end theory will definitely appreciate this endeavor. those of you who are tired of what mtv and other corporate entities and pass off as hip hop clean out your crazy uncle otis's attic check out the beat konducta. then walk down the street to mr. yancey's house go into his basement and check out j dilla's donuts. ,positive,negative,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive,positive
 young jeezy even proclaims not to be a rapper; yet he is a motivational speaker. so in this case he is trying to speak to the youth of hip-hop culture that selling drugs and carrying guns is the cool thing to do. he should just consider himself a rapper; that way when he's using grade-school rhyme patterns to get his message across we can just call him a bad rapper instead of a bad role model. anyways with that diatribe aside this album is nothing new from jeezy. we all saw it coming. he picks out some great beats but cannot provide the great lyrics to go along with them. therefore an uneven album ensues. i luv it was the first single and is a prime example. if this beat might have reached someone such as t.i. or maybe even a group like clipse this would've been a great song. however it's jeezy so it's gonna be a letdown. that's pretty much what this album is; a letdown. after guest spots on grew up a screw up with ludacris and the posse cut remix top back with t.i. & b.g. i was expecting alot from jeezy this time around. however all i got were two tracks (go getta with r. kelly & 3 a.m. with timbaland) that are recommendable. the rest of the album is plagued with horrible lyrics over average-to-above average production. if you're looking for inspiration look away from this trap-star. ,positive,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative

 this cd was supposed to expose a new side of dar willams it has failed to do this. the lyrics and songs are repetitive of previous works. i would suggest buying something else ,negative,negative,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative
 there are only two artists' music that i will purchase not having heard one note of the cd. those two artists are barbra streisand and linda eder. songs of judy garland was a huge disappointment. i was surprised at the cd cover. i don't know what look ms. eder was shooting for but she missed the mark. instead of coming off as 10 years younger she has been transformed to the point of being unrecognizable. she looks both spooky and a little like a petulant child. ms. eder has always been a very attractive woman and definitely did not need this kind of makeover. and the music...i tried so many times to like it. but the more i listended the more i realized i was listening to liza minnelli singing her mother's music. i did not hear linda eder. i'm begging you ms. eder go back to what works. i'm sorry...this doesn't ,negative,negative,negative,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative
 everyone has their favorite beatle. some people love to complain about paul's solo music comparing it to john's. the fact is that each of the beatles had their own style and together they had a magical symbiosis. separately they each pursued a solo career that simply solidified what we already knew. so paul's music is light hearted? maybe even silly? sure but if you are like me and enjoy each beatle for what they brought to the group then this is a wonderful album. no you won't find deep soul searching here just fun! and fun is what this album has in abundance. so if you want to curse paul for his naivet don't buy this album. if you loved the beatles and enjoyed each one for their individual talent this is a fun solo album. in my humble opinion it is paul's best solo album as he really spreads his wings and you can hear the sense of freedom coming through loud and clear. later albums seem to become too engineered and never seem to have the same energy that this album has. ,positive,positive,positive,positive,negative,negative,positive,negative
